# Premise: Employers created 144,000 new payroll jobs in August as the unemployment rate dipped to 5.4 percent, a modest improvement over the 5.5 percent jobless rate in July, the Labor Department reported Friday.
# Hypothesis: The Labor Department said this sector has added nearly 1 of every 5 of the new jobs created during the last 12 months.
# Golden Label: neutral

new_jobs_august_premise = 144000

# the hypothesis talks about the proportion of new jobs added by a certain sector during the last 12 months, which is not mentioned in the premise
# the hypothesis cannot be entailed from the premise, as the premise does not provide information about the sector that added new jobs or the total jobs added during the last 12 months.
