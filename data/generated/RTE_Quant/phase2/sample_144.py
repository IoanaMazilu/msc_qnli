# Hypothesis: The moon Titan has a diameter of 5100 kilometers.
# Golden Label: neutral

# the hypothesis talks about the diameter of Titan which is not referenced in the premise
# the premise talks about the distances of Uranus and Neptune from the sun, which are not referenced in the hypothesis
# therefore, the hypothesis cannot be entailed or contradicted by the premise
