# Premise: Due to these effects, a person who has consumed a high amount of alcohol in a short amount of time will undoubtedly have difficulty driving. Each year, more than 10,000 people ages 16-25 die as the result of alcohol use and half of those deaths result from crashes caused by alcohol-impaired driving.
# Hypothesis: Half of road-traffic deaths are caused by alcohol.
# Golden Label: neutral

total_deaths_premise = 10000
half_deaths_premise = total_deaths_premise / 2

# the hypothesis talks about the proportion of road-traffic deaths caused by alcohol, but does not specify the age group or the total number of deaths.
# we have no information about the total number of road-traffic deaths or the proportion caused by alcohol in all age groups.
