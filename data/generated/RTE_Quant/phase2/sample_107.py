# Premise: Commandos stormed a school Friday in southern Russia and battled separatist rebels holding hundreds of hostages as crying children, some naked and covered in blood, fled the building through explosions and gunfire.
# Hypothesis: The total number of hostages held in the school may have been as many as 1,200.
# Golden Label: neutral

# no specific number of hostages is mentioned in the premise
hostages_hypothesis = 1200

# the hypothesis talks about a possible number of hostages which cannot be contradicted or entailed from the premise because the premise does not provide a specific number
label = "neutral"
