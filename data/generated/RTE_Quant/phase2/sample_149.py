# Premise: Police in Rio de Janeiro arrested five men and recovered millions of dollars worth of art stolen earlier this month, including works by Salvador Dali and Henri Matisse. Police recovered all the stolen art except two Chinese ceramic sculptures from the 7th Century and a collection of silverware.
# Hypothesis: Millions of dollars of art were recovered, including works by Dali.
# Golden Label: entailment
