# Premise: This coalition took seven months to form, the longest deadlock in Dutch history. It occurred only after negotiations between the CDA and the PvdA failed, first over tax issues, then over the issue of abortion.
# Hypothesis: Three parties form a Dutch coalition government.
# Golden Label: neutral

# No numerical entities to compare in this case

# the hypothesis talks about the number of parties forming the Dutch coalition government
# the premise does not mention anything about the number of parties involved, only the duration and the failed negotiations
# therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction, only neutrality
label = "neutral"
