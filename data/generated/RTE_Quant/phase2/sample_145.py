# Premise: Mars has the smallest confirmed moon, Deimos, which is about 7.5 miles in diameter.
# Hypothesis: The terrestrial moon has a diameter of 3746 kilometers.
# Golden Label: neutral

# the premise and hypothesis are talking about two different moons, so we cannot infer entailment or contradiction
