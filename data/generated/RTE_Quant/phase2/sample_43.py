# Premise: The Czech and Slovak republics have been unable to agree a political basis for their future coexistence in one country.
# Hypothesis: The Czech and Slovak republics do not agree to coexist in one country.
# Golden Label: entailment

# the premise and hypothesis both talk about the agreement between Czech and Slovak republics for coexistence
# there's no numerical information to compare or calculate in this case

# since both premise and hypothesis agree that the republics are unable to agree for coexistence, we can infer entailment
