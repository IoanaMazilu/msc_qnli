# Hypothesis: The forces took millions of shekels in cash from the bank.
# Golden Label: neutral

# There are no specific quantities given in both sentences. Hence, no variables can be defined.

# the hypothesis talks about the seizure of millions of shekels from the bank which is not contradicted by the premise
# However, the premise does not provide a specific amount of money seized, hence it cannot confirm the hypothesis either.
