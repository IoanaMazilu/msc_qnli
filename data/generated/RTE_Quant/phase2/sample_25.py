# Premise: The diameter of the moon cake is 2.1 meters.
# Hypothesis: The terrestrial moon has a diameter of 3,746 kilometers.
# Golden Label: neutral

moon_cake_diameter_premise = 2.1 # in meters
moon_diameter_hypothesis = 3746 * 1000 # in meters

# the hypothesis talks about the diameter of the terrestrial moon, which is not referenced in the premise (the premise talks about a moon cake)
# the hypothesis cannot be entailed from the premise, since the diameter of the terrestrial moon is unrelated to the diameter of the moon cake.
