# Premise: Hurricane Frances destroyed more of the citrus crop in some places in Florida than Hurricane Charley did three weeks ago, the state's agriculture commissioner said on Tuesday.
# Hypothesis: Initial reports of destruction did not rival the estimated $7.4 billion in insured damage caused by Hurricane Charley in southwest Florida three weeks ago.
# Golden Label: neutral

# Damage in dollars by Hurricane Charley
damage_Charley = 7.4e9 

# There are no quantities mentioned in the hypothesis or premise to directly compare.
# The premise talks about the destruction of the citrus crop (no specific quantity or monetary value given) while the hypothesis talks about the insured damage value.
# Therefore, without more specific numbers or a direct comparison, we cannot infer contradiction or entailment.
