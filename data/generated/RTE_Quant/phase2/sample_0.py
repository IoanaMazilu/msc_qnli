# Premise: In 1956 Accardo won the Geneva Competition and in 1958 became the first prize winner of the Paganini Competition in Genoa. He has recorded Paganini's famous 24 Caprices (re-recorded in 1999) for solo violin and was the first to record all six of the Paganini Violin Concertos.
# Hypothesis: Accardo composed 24 Caprices.
# Golden Label: neutral

accardo_caprices_premise = 24
accardo_caprices_hypothesis = 24

# the hypothesis talks about Accardo composing the 24 Caprices, while in the premise it is stated that Accardo recorded them
# we can't infer from the premise that Accardo composed the Caprices, so the relation is neutral
label = "neutral"
