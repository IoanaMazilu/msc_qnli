# Premise: He said that '' there is evidence that Cristiani was involved in the murder of the six Jesuit priests'' which occurred on 16 November in San Salvador.
# Hypothesis: Cristiani killed six Jesuits.
# Golden Label: neutral

# Number of priests in premise and hypothesis
priests_premise = 6
priests_hypothesis = 6

# Involvement of Cristiani in the murder (1 implies involvement)
cristiani_involvement_premise = 1
cristiani_involvement_hypothesis = 1

# the hypothesis talks about Cristiani's involvement in the murder, which is also mentioned in the premise
# but the hypothesis directly states Cristiani as the killer without any evidence, which is not mentioned in the premise
# So, no entailment or contradiction can be inferred here.
