# Premise: At the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Didrikson won gold medals in the javelin (Olympic record) and 80-meter hurdles (world record), along with a silver in the high jump (share of the world record).
# Hypothesis: 2,45 m is the world record in the high jump.
# Golden Label: neutral

# No numerical values are given in the premise or the hypothesis to compare
# The premise doesn't give a numerical value for the high jump record
# The hypothesis provides a numerical value for the high jump record but it does not indicate whether this value is from the 1932 Olympic Games

# Thus, no comparison between the premise and hypothesis can be made
label = "neutral"
