# Premise: A militant group beheaded three Iraqi Kurdish hostages, showing the killings in a videotape posted on a Web site yesterday, while another group announced that it had kidnapped at least 15 Iraqi National Guardsmen.
# Hypothesis: A group claimed to have kidnapped 15 members of the Iraqi National Guard.
# Golden Label: entailment

# defining the variables

else:
