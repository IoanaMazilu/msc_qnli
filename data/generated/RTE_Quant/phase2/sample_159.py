# Hypothesis: Before the late 1980's some nations even gave land and tax credit to individuals and companies slashing, burning, and exploiting the forest.
# Golden Label: neutral

land_clearance_requirement_premise = 0.8
# The premise does not mention any tax credits or the exploitation of forests
# The hypothesis does not mention the percentage of land that needed to be cleared for ownership

# Since there is no common numerical entity between the two sentences, we can't make a direct comparison
