# Premise: Romania's is one of the largest contingents of any European country in Iraq due to the recent withdrawals or downscaling of Spain, Italy, the Ukraine and Poland. Romania has so far been one of the only NATO countries not announcing a withdrawal.
# Hypothesis: Romania sent 730 troops in Iraq.
# Golden Label: neutral

# There's no numerical information in the premise to define variables, 
# but the hypothesis mentions that 730 troops were sent by Romania in Iraq.

troops_hypothesis = 730

# The hypothesis provides the number of troops Romania sent to Iraq, but this information is not mentioned in the premise.
# Since the premise does not provide any information to compare with the hypothesis, we can infer neutrality. 

label = "neutral"
