# Premise: U.S. economy off to slow start in 2017 under Trump.
# Hypothesis: GDP Report Shows US Economy Off to Slow Start in 2017.
# Golden Label: entailment

# Both premise and hypothesis mention the U.S economy's slow start in 2017
# However, they do not provide any numerical data to be compared or make any numerical claims that contradict or entail each other
# Therefore, we cannot make an entailment or contradiction conclusion based on numerical comparison.
