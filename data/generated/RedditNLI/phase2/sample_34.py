# Premise: Based off of 1st unemployment reports the jobs report for June will probably be unchanged from May.
# Hypothesis: Based off 1st time unemployment claims, the June report will likely be exactly the same as May's.
# Golden Label: entailment

# the premise and hypothesis both reference to 1st time unemployment reports and the unchanged jobs report for June from May
# no numerical comparison is needed in this case, as no numerical values are provided that can be contradicted or entailed
# however, the hypothesis specifies that the June report will be "exactly the same" as May's, which cannot be explicitly entailed from the premise
