# Premise: US new home sales fall 1.6 percent in November.
# Hypothesis: November home sales slowest in 6 months.
# Golden Label: neutral

sales_change_premise = -1.6 # percent
months_hypothesis = 6

# the premise and hypothesis provide different aspects about November home sales
# the premise shows that sales fell by 1.6 percent, but does not provide an explicit comparison to other months
# the hypothesis states that November was the slowest in 6 months, but does not provide a percentage change

# thus, neither statement can be fully and explicitly entailed from the other
