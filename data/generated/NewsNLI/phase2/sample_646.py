# Premise: '' We hope these two advisers are freed quickly, but we are shocked that they were passing themselves off as journalists,'' Reporters Without Borders said.
# Hypothesis: The two advisers had apparently told the hotel they were journalists.
# Golden Label: neutral

# In this case, there are no numerical entities in the sentences, thus we cannot define variables or perform numerical comparison
# Both premise and hypothesis mention that the two advisers were posing as journalists
# While the premise shows Reporters Without Borders expressing shock over this, the hypothesis merely states that the advisers had claimed to be journalists to the hotel
# Therefore, the relationship is neutral as the hypothesis does not contradict or fully entail the premise.
