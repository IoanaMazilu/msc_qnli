# Premise: Sometimes referred to as the'' Kingdom of the Sky,'' Lesotho is completely landlocked by South Africa and is the only country in the world where all of the land lies above 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) in elevation.
# Hypothesis: Lesotho is a mountainous nation of 2 million people landlocked by South Africa.
# Golden Label: neutral

population_hypothesis = 2000000

# therefore, we cannot make a comparison between the premise and the hypothesis based on this information
# the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
