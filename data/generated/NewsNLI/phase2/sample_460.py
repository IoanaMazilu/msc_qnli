# There are no numerical entities or quantities in the given sentences. Therefore, no variables need to be defined.
# The comparison is purely based on the qualitative information given in the sentences.

# The premise implies that this is the first meeting between Kim (presumably representing one of the Koreas) and a top official from China since the flareup between the two Koreas.
# The hypothesis states that this is the first meeting between the two nations since the flareup.
# While the premise specifies who the participants of the meeting are, the hypothesis is more general, stating the meeting is between the two nations.

# Given that the premise provides more specific detail (i.e., the participants of the meeting), but the hypothesis does not contradict this, a neutral relation can be inferred.
