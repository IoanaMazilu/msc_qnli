# Premise: Researchers at the University of Michigan said Denmark's prosperity, stability and democratic government placed the country at the top of the rankings, with Colombia, Canada, Puerto Rico and Iceland all in the top 10.
# Hypothesis: Top 10 include seven European nations, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Canada.
# Golden Label: neutral

# The premise does not provide information about the number of European countries in the top 10, 
# hence no numerical value can be assigned to any variable in this case.

# The hypothesis provides a specific number of European countries in the top 10, but this cannot be entailed from the premise.
