# Premise: The main issue was whether a 408-foot needle atop the One World Trade Center would be counted in the total height of the tower.
# Hypothesis: One World Trade Center ruled to be taller than Willis Tower.
# Golden Label: neutral

# There is no numerical comparison possible between the premise and the hypothesis
# The premise discusses a question about the total height of the One World Trade Center but does not provide a resolution
# The hypothesis states a fact about the One World Trade Center being taller than the Willis Tower but does not provide specific heights
# Therefore, the relationship is neutral as the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
