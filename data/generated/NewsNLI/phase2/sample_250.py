# Hypothesis: He uttered the now-famous phrase:'' That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind.''
# Golden Label: entailment

# There are no numerical entities in this example, so no variables to define

# the hypothesis refers to the exact same quote from Armstrong, as mentioned in the premise
# so, it can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
