# Premise: Competitive bidding would have cut costs on a standard power wheelchair by nearly $1,000, the report says.
# Hypothesis: Standard power wheelchair costs Medicare $4,018 to lease.
# Golden Label: neutral

# the hypothesis mentions a specific cost for leasing a wheelchair, which cannot be directly inferred from the premise
# the premise refers to a cost reduction related to competitive bidding, but the exact cost isn't stated
# hence, no comparison is needed
