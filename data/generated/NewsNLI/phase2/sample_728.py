# Premise: The second, Mary Kristene Chapa, 18, was in serious condition at a local hospital with a gunshot wound to the head.
# Hypothesis: One victim died, the other is in serious condition.
# Golden Label: neutral

# From the premise
victim_chapa_age_premise = 18
victim_chapa_condition_premise = "serious"

# From the hypothesis
# We don't have any numerical information to extract

# While the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, it does not provide any numerical information that could be used for a direct comparison.
# It only mentions the condition of one victim, which matches the premise, but lacks further details.
# Therefore, the relation is neutral.
