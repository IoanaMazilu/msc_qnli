# Premise: NEW YORK (CNN) -- More than $20 million from dozens of clients is unaccounted for in the aftermath of what police say was a murder-suicide by the attorney who invested the money, according to a source with direct knowledge of deceased lawyer William Parente's financial dealings.
# Hypothesis: Parente may have taken more than $27 million from dozens of clients.
# Golden Label: neutral

money_unaccounted_premise = 20000000
money_taken_hypothesis = 27000000

# the hypothesis suggests a possible amount of money taken by Parente, which is also discussed in the premise
# however, the hypothesis gives a specific figure which is larger than the one mentioned in the premise
if money_taken_hypothesis > money_unaccounted_premise:
    # check if the amount of money taken in the hypothesis contradicts the amount of unaccounted money reported in the premise
    label = "contradiction"
else:
    # if the hypothesis amount does not contradict the premise amount, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction, so the relation is neutral
    label = "neutral"
