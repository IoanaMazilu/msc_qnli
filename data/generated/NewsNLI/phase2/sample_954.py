# Premise: Ruiz is suspected of killing the two sisters, said Leandro Osorio, chief of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.
# Hypothesis: The boyfriend had the most contact with the two sisters, police say.
# Golden Label: neutral

# There are no numerical entities in this example, so no variables are defined.

# The premise and the hypothesis both mention the two sisters.
# However, the premise talks about Ruiz being suspected of killing them, while the hypothesis mentions that the boyfriend had the most contact with them.
# It's unclear whether Ruiz and the boyfriend are the same person, so we cannot infer entailment or contradiction.
