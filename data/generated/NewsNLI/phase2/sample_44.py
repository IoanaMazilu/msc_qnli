# Premise: The bogey-free feat means Noh is the first player to complete 54 holes at the TPC Louisiana course without dropping a shot.
# Hypothesis: Korean is first golfer to achieve three consecutive unblemished rounds at TPC Louisiana course.
# Golden Label: entailment

# both premise and hypothesis refer to the same situation
# but the premise specifies the person as 'Noh' while hypothesis refers to him as 'Korean'
# hence, variables are not needed in this case as there are no numerical entities for comparison purposes

# since the identity of the person is not explicitly defined in the hypothesis, we infer neutrality
