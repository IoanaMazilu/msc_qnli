# Premise: -- The phone will be called the iPhone 5 or iPhone 4S.
# Hypothesis: Rumor has it the phone will be called iPhone 5 or iPhone 4S.
# Golden Label: entailment

# The premise and hypothesis do not contain any numerical entities, hence no variables are defined
# The hypothesis rephrases the premise. However, both premise and hypothesis are indefinite about the name of the phone
# Therefore, no direct contradiction or entailment can be established
