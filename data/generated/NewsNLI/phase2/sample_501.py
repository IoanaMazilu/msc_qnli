# Premise: (CNN) -- A California lettuce grower has recalled 2,498 cartons of chopped or shredded romaine lettuce shipped to wholesale food service distributors in 19 states and Canada over concerns the produce may be contaminated with the same bacteria that caused 13 deaths in an outbreak traced to tainted cantaloupes.
# Hypothesis: The recall involves the same bacteria that caused 13 deaths from tainted cantaloupes.
# Golden Label: neutral

recalled_cartons_premise = 2498
states_premise = 19
deaths_premise = 13

deaths_hypothesis = 13

# the hypothesis mentions the number of deaths caused by the bacteria, which is also referenced in the premise
# however, the hypothesis does not mention the number of recalled cartons or the number of states involved in the premise
# so, we can't infer entailment or contradiction based on this information
label = "neutral"
