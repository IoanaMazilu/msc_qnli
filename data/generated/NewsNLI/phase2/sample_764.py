# Premise: The French National Assembly assembled a cross-party panel of 32 lawmakers to study whether women in France should be allowed to wear the burqa -- or any other full veil, including the niqab, which shows only the eyes.
# Hypothesis: Government estimates less than 2,000 women in France wear the full veil.
# Golden Label: neutral

# there are no numerical entities in the premise to define any variables
women_veil_hypothesis = 2000

# the hypothesis mentions the number of women in France who wear the full veil, which is not referenced in the premise
# therefore, we cannot infer entailment nor contradiction, leading to a neutral relation
label = "neutral"
