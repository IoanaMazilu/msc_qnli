# Premise: (CNN) -- Mark Webber's second place behind Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel in the Japanese Grand Prix sees the Australian stretch his lead in the world title race to 14 points.
# Hypothesis: Mark Webber extends lead at top of the Formula One world championship race.
# Golden Label: neutral

lead_points_premise = 14

# the hypothesis mentions Mark Webber extending his lead in the championship race, which is also mentioned in the premise
# however, the hypothesis does not provide any specific numerical information that can be compared with the premise
# therefore, we don't have to perform any comparisons and we can directly infer neutrality
label = "neutral"
