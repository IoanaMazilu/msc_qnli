# Premise: Samsung, however, built the Galaxy Note 10.1 from the ground up for pen use.
# Hypothesis: On the Saumsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet, the stylus pen is the key.
# Golden Label: entailment

# No numerical entities in both premise and hypothesis, so no variables to define.

# As there are no numerical values, there are no comparisons to be made.

# The hypothesis is talking about the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 being built for pen use,
# which is in line with the premise, but it does not provide enough information to fully entail the premise.
