# Premise: After they complete their sentence, the pair will be deported.
# Hypothesis: The two Britons will be deported after they complete their sentence.
# Golden Label: neutral

# In this case, there are no numerical entities to be compared.
# The premise and the hypothesis both refer to the same event, but from different perspectives. 

# Since no contradiction can be found and the hypothesis can be fully entailed from the premise, we infer entailment
