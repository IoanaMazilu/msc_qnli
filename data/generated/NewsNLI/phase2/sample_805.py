# Premise: Needing to win to stay in the tournament, England failed to capitalize on a quick start to their innings, losing a clutch of wickets in the middle period to post a modest total of 243.
# Hypothesis: West Indies fall short of England's modest total of 243.
# Golden Label: neutral

total_premise = 243
total_hypothesis = 243

# the hypothesis states that West Indies failed to reach England's total, which does not contradict the premise
# however, the hypothesis does not mention the performance of England's team, so it cannot be fully entailed from the premise
label = "neutral"
