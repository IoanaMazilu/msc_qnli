# Premise: More than half a million sandbags have been prepared, the statement said, adding that people in flood areas are being told to move to safety.
# Hypothesis: Fifty homes have been damaged across the state, according to the statement.
# Golden Label: neutral

sandbags_premise = 500000
# the hypothesis does not provide a number for the sandbags, thus we can't create a variable for it
homes_damaged_hypothesis = 50
# the premise does not provide a number for the damaged homes, thus we can't create a variable for it

# the hypothesis mentions the number of damaged homes, which is not referenced in the premise
# the premise mentions the number of sandbags prepared, which is not referenced in the hypothesis
# consequently, there is no numerical information that we can compare between the premise and the hypothesis
