# Premise: Perhaps the St. Andrews New Course (greens fee, $110), a tough-as-nails layout with the fastest greens in town, might be thrown in for good measure.
# Hypothesis: St. Andrews Links Trust manages seven courses in and around the town.
# Golden Label: neutral

greens_fee_premise = 110

# the hypothesis does not mention the greens fee or the characteristic of the course
# as the premise does, and adds information about the management of seven courses which cannot be inferred
# from the premise
label = "neutral"
