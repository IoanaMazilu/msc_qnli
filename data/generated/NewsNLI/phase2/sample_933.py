# Premise: It weighed more than 40,000 pounds, but more than 85% of that weight was sand, shells and water, she said.
# Hypothesis: The slab of weathered crude and sand was more than 160 feet long.
# Golden Label: neutral

# The hypothesis doesn't give a numerical value for the weight, so it cannot be compared

# There's no mention of the length in the premise, so we can't compare it with the length mentioned in the hypothesis
