# Premise: Three of those arrested are still in custody, including the two men who allegedly hacked to death British soldier Lee Rigby.
# Hypothesis: Two men in Grimsby, England, are arrested on suspicion of arson.
# Golden Label: neutral

arrested_premise = 3
arrested_hypothesis = 2

# The hypothesis mentions the number of people arrested in England, which is less than the number mentioned in the premise
# However, the hypothesis refers to a different crime (arson), which cannot be entailed from the premise
# Therefore, we can't make a valid comparison between the variables
