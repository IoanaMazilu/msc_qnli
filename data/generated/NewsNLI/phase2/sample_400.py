# Premise: '' It was her blunders that made us know that she was one of us.''
# Hypothesis: Godfather:'' Her blunders... made us know that she was one of us''
# Golden Label: entailment

# There are no numerical entities to compare in this case. 
# The comparison would be based on the textual information.

# The hypothesis is a subset of the premise, and no contradiction or additional information is presented.
# Therefore, we can infer entailment.
