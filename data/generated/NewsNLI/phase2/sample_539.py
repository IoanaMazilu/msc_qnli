# Premise: '' Although we are aware that people are trying to convince other legislatures to go down this path, I think it's clear that both as a policy matter and a legal matter, that Arizona's approach is the wrong one,'' he said.
# Hypothesis: '' Arizona's approach is the wrong one,'' ACLU attorney says.
# Golden Label: entailment

# There are no numerical entities in the premise or the hypothesis

# The hypothesis quotes the statement from the premise without adding or subtracting anything
# There is no way to determine if the speaker is an ACLU attorney from the premise, so the label is neutral
label = "neutral"
