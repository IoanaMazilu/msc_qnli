# Premise: Because even if this sentence is ultimately legal, you may still conclude that it is an immoral one.
# Hypothesis: He says even if the sentence is legal, it may not be a moral one.
# Golden Label: entailment

# In this case, there are no numerical or quantifiable entities present in the sentences so direct comparison is not applicable

# The premise and hypothesis are referring to the same theoretical situation regarding the legality and morality of a sentence

# However, the premise and hypothesis are not identical in wording and each could be interpreted slightly differently

# Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is neutral

label = "neutral"
