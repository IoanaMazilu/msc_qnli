# Premise: '' It is an historic and symbolic moment that an Indian driver is on the grid and, of course, there is a lot following Formula One for a long time,'' the Hispania Racing Team driver told F1's official website.
# Hypothesis: Indian Formula One driver says the race can boost the sport's popularity.
# Golden Label: neutral

# The premise does not provide any numerical entities, so no variables are defined.

# The premise mentions an Indian driver who is part of the Formula One grid, suggesting that there is a lot of interest in the sport. 
# The hypothesis also talks about an Indian Formula One driver who believes the race can boost the sport's popularity.
# However, the premise does not explicitly state that the race can boost the sport's popularity, which is what the hypothesis claims, so we cannot entail this from the premise.
