# Premise: Proposition 8 supporters also announced the addition of Kenneth Starr to their legal team.
# Hypothesis: Sponsors also respond to lawsuits seeking to invalidate Prop 8.
# Golden Label: neutral

# There are no numerical entities in the sentences, thus no variables are defined.

# The premise mentions that supporters of Proposition 8 added Kenneth Starr to their legal team, but does not provide information on their responses to lawsuits. 
# The hypothesis states that sponsors responded to lawsuits seeking to invalidate Proposition 8, but does not specify any actions or the addition of any legal members. 

# Since the premise does not mention anything about the sponsors' response to lawsuits and the hypothesis does not mention anything about the addition of a legal team member, we cannot infer any entailment or contradiction.
