# Premise: But even Valin wonders what kind of person would pay $64,000 for a turntable.
# Hypothesis: An Italian manufacturer unveils a $64,000 turntable at CES in Las Vegas.
# Golden Label: neutral

turntable_price_premise = 64000
turntable_price_hypothesis = 64000

# both the premise and the hypothesis mention a turntable priced at $64,000
# however, the premise questions who would buy such a turntable, while the hypothesis only states that it is unveiled at CES in Las Vegas
# the information in the hypothesis neither contradicts nor is entailed by the premise
label = "neutral"
