# Hypothesis: Unemployment rate in Kentucky is 11.1 percent.
# Golden Label: neutral

# the hypothesis mentions the overall unemployment rate in Kentucky, while the premise specifies the unemployment rate in Perry County, which is part of Kentucky
# we cannot infer if the overall unemployment rate in Kentucky is higher or lower than in Perry County
# thus, we cannot conclude entailment or contradiction based on this information
