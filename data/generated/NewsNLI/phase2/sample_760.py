# the hypothesis mentions that the Democratic senators are urged to return to the Capitol, which is also mentioned in the premise
# however, the hypothesis does not reference the potential layoffs of individuals, which is a key element of the premise
# therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction based on the available numerical information
