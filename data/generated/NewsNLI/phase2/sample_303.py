# Premise: One sailor remained hospitalized and underwent surgery for a broken arm, the Navy said.
# Hypothesis: One sailor remains hospitalized, the Navy says.
# Golden Label: entailment

# however, the premise gives additional information about the sailor's condition that is not present in the hypothesis
