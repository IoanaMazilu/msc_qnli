# Premise: '' This situation is a desperate one that made us take the decision we did,'' he said, adding that,'' we will not leave the park until we have our housing.''
# Hypothesis: One squatter says they will not leave the park until they get homes.
# Golden Label: neutral

# There are no numerical entities in these sentences, so no variables need to be defined.

# The hypothesis essentially repeats the claim made in the premise, but from the point of view of a single squatter.
# Since there are no numerical entities to compare, we can only compare the claims made in the sentences.
# Both sentences contain the claim that the squatters will not leave the park until they have housing.
