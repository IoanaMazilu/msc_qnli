# Premise: Varane played 23 matches for Lens last season, and despite the club being relegated from Ligue 1, he impressed with his displays.
# Hypothesis: Varane impressed for Lens last season despite their relegation from Ligue 1.
# Golden Label: entailment

matches_played_premise = 23

# The hypothesis does not mention the number of matches played by Varane, which is mentioned in the premise.
# There is no numerical or quantity-based comparison to be made between the premise and hypothesis.
# However, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either.
