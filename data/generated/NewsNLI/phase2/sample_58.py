# Premise: The photo of a tousle-haired, thinly goateed Tsarnaev is one the suspect posted online himself and has been picked up by other outlets.
# Hypothesis: The image is one Tsarnaev himself posted online ; it's been published widely before.
# Golden Label: entailment

# There are no numerical entities in the sentences, so no variables are defined.

# The hypothesis mentions that the image was posted by Tsarnaev and had been published before, both of which are mentioned in the premise.
# There is no additional information in the hypothesis that can't be entailed from the premise, so the label is "entailment".
label = "entailment"
