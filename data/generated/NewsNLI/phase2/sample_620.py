# Premise: Even though the club does n't sell marijuana, the advocate said it'' thwart (s) the intent of Amendment 64,'' which requires a year-long waiting period before stores are allowed to open and sell marijuana.
# Hypothesis: Some marijuana advocates say the club violates the intent of Amendment 64.
# Golden Label: neutral

# There is no numerical or quantifiable information in the sentences, so no comparison is needed

# The hypothesis and premise both discuss the intent of Amendment 64 in relation to the club's actions,
# but they do not provide enough information to clearly infer if the club is violating or thwarting the intent of the amendment
