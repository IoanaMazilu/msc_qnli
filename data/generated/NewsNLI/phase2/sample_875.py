# Premise: Bobby Jindal declared a statewide state of emergency.
# Hypothesis: Florida governor declares a state of emergency in 18 counties.
# Golden Label: neutral

# In this case, there are no numerical entities to compare.
# The premise and the hypothesis refer to different people declaring state of emergencies in different locations.
# Hence, no meaningful comparison can be done.
