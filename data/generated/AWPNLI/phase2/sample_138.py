# Premise: Mrs. Hilt reads 5.0 books a day.
# Hypothesis: She read 15.0 books.
# Golden Label: entailment

books_per_day_premise = 5.0
total_books_hypothesis = 15.0

# the hypothesis refers to the total number of books read, which is not specifically mentioned in the premise
# we can however make an estimation based on the premise
# we can assume that she read books for more than one day. 
# But without knowing the exact number of days she read, we can't make a direct comparison
# hence, no comparison can be made and we can't infer entailment or contradiction
