# Premise: Christianâ€™s father and the senior ranger gathered firewood as they walked towards the lake in the park and brought with them sacks, and every sack can contain around 20.0 pieces of wood.
# Hypothesis: They were able to fill 6.0 sacks if they gathered 80.0 pieces of wood.
# Golden Label: contradiction
