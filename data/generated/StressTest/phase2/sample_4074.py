# Premise: What was the difference between the total monthly salary of Arun in all the years together and Suman's monthly income in the year 2007?
# Hypothesis: What was the difference between the total monthly salary of Arun in all the years together and Suman's monthly income in the year less than 6007?
# Golden Label: entailment

# the premise and hypothesis do not provide specific numerical values, only a reference to them
# the difference between the total monthly salary of Arun and Suman's monthly income is referenced in both the premise and hypothesis
# but the premise refers to a specific year (2007) while the hypothesis is less specific and refers to a year less than 6007
# without specific numerical values, we can't make a direct comparison or calculation
# the relation can't be determined as entailment or contradiction, therefore the label is "neutral"

label = "neutral"
