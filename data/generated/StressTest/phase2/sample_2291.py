# Premise: How many jelly beans must Dante give to Aaron to ensure that no child has more than 1 fewer jelly beans than any other child?
# Hypothesis: How many jelly beans must Dante give to Aaron to ensure that no child has more than more than 1 fewer jelly beans than any other child?
# Golden Label: contradiction

# In this case, both the premise and the hypothesis are identical, except for a typo in the hypothesis ('more than more than').
# Therefore, there is no numerical information to compare or perform calculations on.
