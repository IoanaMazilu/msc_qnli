# Golden Label: contradiction

# There are no numerical entities that can be directly compared in the premise and hypothesis
# The premise and hypothesis are asking the same question but with different conditions
# The condition in the hypothesis is more restrictive than the premise
# Thus, we cannot determine the entailment or contradiction based on the given sentences.
# So, the relationship between the sentences is neutral.
