# Premise: If Jerry wants to raise his average by 2 points, what score must he earn on the fourth test?
# Hypothesis: If Jerry wants to raise his average by 4 points, what score must he earn on the fourth test?

# The hypothesis and premise refer to Jerry's desired increase in average test score
# There's no numerical information to compare, only a change in the desired increase, thus we cannot infer entailment or contradiction
