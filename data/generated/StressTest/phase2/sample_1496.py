# Premise: Level-1 college graduates account for 15% of Listco's sales staff.
# Hypothesis: Level-2 college graduates account for 15% of Listco's sales staff.
# Golden Label: contradiction

level1_grads_premise = 15
level2_grads_hypothesis = 15

# the hypothesis refers to the percentage of level-2 graduates in the sales staff, while the premise talks about level-1 graduates
# there is no information provided about the relationship between these two groups or if they are mutually exclusive or not

# thus, no comparison can be made between 'level1_grads_premise' and 'level2_grads_hypothesis'
# no conclusions can be drawn about the entailment or contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis
