# Premise: If the number of such passengers that used Miami Airport was 1/2 the number that used Kennedy Airport and 4 times the number that used Logan Airport, approximately how many millions of these passengers used Logan Airport that year?
# Hypothesis: If the number of such passengers that used Miami Airport was more than 1/2 the number that used Kennedy Airport and 4 times the number that used Logan Airport, approximately how many millions of these passengers used Logan Airport that year?
# Golden Label: contradiction

# The premise and hypothesis are the same except for the "more than" in the hypothesis.
# Since both premise and hypothesis are questions, there are no specific numbers given to compare.
# Therefore, we cannot make a decision based on numerical comparison.
