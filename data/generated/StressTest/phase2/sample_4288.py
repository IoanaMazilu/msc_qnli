# Premise: If the probability that Catherine is adjacent to Caroline is less than 7/9, then what is the value of n?
# Hypothesis: If the probability that Catherine is adjacent to Caroline is 1/9, then what is the value of n?
# Golden Label: neutral

probability_premise = 7/9
probability_hypothesis = 1/9

# the hypothesis refers to the probability that Catherine is adjacent to Caroline, which is also mentioned in the premise

    # check if the probability in the hypothesis contradicts the probability in the premise
    label = "contradiction"
else:
    # the premise gives only an upper limit for the probability
    # any probability less than 'probability_premise' is consistent with the premise, but cannot be explicitly entailed from the premise
