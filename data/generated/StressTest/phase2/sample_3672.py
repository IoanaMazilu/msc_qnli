# Premise: The ratio between the number of sheep and the number of horses at the Stewart farm is 5 to 7, If each horse is fed 230 ounces of horse food per day and the farm needs a total 12,880 ounces of horse food per day, what is the number of sheep in the farm?
# Hypothesis: The ratio between the number of sheep and the number of horses at the Stewart farm is less than 7 to 7, If each horse is fed 230 ounces of horse food per day and the farm needs a total 12,880 ounces of horse food per day, what is the number of sheep in the farm?
