# Premise: How many jelly beans must Dante give to Aaron to ensure that no child has more than 1 fewer jelly beans than any other child?
# Hypothesis: How many jelly beans must Dante give to Aaron to ensure that no child has more than 6 fewer jelly beans than any other child?
# Golden Label: contradiction

# In this case, there are no numerical entities involved and the premise and hypothesis are asking the same question
# but with a different number of fewer jelly beans. Since there is no comparison possible, the relationship is neutral.
