# Premise: If A and B are digits and 5 AB is a 3-digit number that is divisible by 10, which of the following is a possible product of A and C?
# Hypothesis: If A and B are digits and more than 5 AB is a 3-digit number that is divisible by 10, which of the following is a possible product of A and C?
# Golden Label: contradiction

# The premise and hypothesis do not provide any numerical entities that can be extracted and compared. 
# Both premise and hypothesis are conditional statements with unknown variables which cannot be used for comparisons.
# Hence, we cannot infer entailment, contradiction, or neutrality based on the provided sentences.
