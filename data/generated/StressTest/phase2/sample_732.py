# Premise: If A and B are digits and 5 AB is a 3-digit number that is divisible by 10, which of the following is a possible product of A and C?
# Hypothesis: If A and B are digits and less than 7 AB is a 3-digit number that is divisible by 10, which of the following is a possible product of A and C?
# Golden Label: entailment

# since the premise and hypothesis are purely theoretical and do not provide actual quantities or numerical information,
# there are no variables to compare and no possible way to infer entailment, contradiction or neutrality
# thus, we can only conclude that the relation is neutral
label = "neutral"
