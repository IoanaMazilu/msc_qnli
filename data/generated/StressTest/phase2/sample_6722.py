# Premise: How many jelly beans must Dante give to Aaron to ensure that no child has more than 1 fewer jelly beans than any other child?
# Hypothesis: How many jelly beans must Dante give to Aaron to ensure that no child has more than less than 1 fewer jelly beans than any other child?
# Golden Label: contradiction

# the premise and the hypothesis are questions about the same situation
# but there is no explicit numerical information in either of them
# so there is no way to determine entailment or contradiction through numerical comparison
