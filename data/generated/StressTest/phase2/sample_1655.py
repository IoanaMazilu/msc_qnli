# Premise: How many hours does it take Little Texas Drilling Company to produce 100 barrels of oil?
# Hypothesis: How many hours does it take Little Texas Drilling Company to produce 700 barrels of oil?
# Golden Label: contradiction

barrels_premise = 100
barrels_hypothesis = 700

# the hypothesis refers to the number of barrels produced by Little Texas Drilling Company, as mentioned in the premise
# there is no concrete number given in the premise to compare with the hypothesis
# thus, no matter how many barrels are mentioned in the hypothesis, the relation is neutral
label = "neutral"
