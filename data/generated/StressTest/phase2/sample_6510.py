# Premise: If X, Y and Z are digits and 7 XYZ is a 4-digit number that is divisible by 2, which of the following is a possible product of X, Y and Z?
# Hypothesis: If X, Y and Z are digits and more than 5 XYZ is a 4-digit number that is divisible by 2, which of the following is a possible product of X, Y and Z?
# Golden Label: entailment

# The premise and hypothesis do not provide concrete numerical values to perform comparison operations.
# However, they discuss similar conditions for XYZ being digits and forming a 4-digit number divisible by 2.

# The premise and hypothesis are neutral as the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but also cannot be explicitly entailed from the premise.
label = "neutral"
