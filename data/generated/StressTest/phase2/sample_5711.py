# Premise: A “ Sophie Germain ” prime is any positive prime number p for which 2 p + 1 is also prime.
# Hypothesis: A “ Sophie Germain ” prime is any positive prime number p for which less than 2 p + 1 is also prime.
# Golden Label: contradiction

# There are no explicit numbers in the premise or hypothesis, but they both refer to a mathematical formula
# We define the formulas as lambda functions for comparison

formula_premise = lambda p: 2*p + 1
formula_hypothesis = lambda p: 2*p 

# The hypothesis refers to the same mathematical concept mentioned in the premise
# We compare the two formulas for a given prime number p to see if they contradict or entail each other
p = 1  # assign any positive prime number to p

if formula_hypothesis(p) >= formula_premise(p):
    # check if the formula in the hypothesis contradicts the formula in the premise
    label = "contradiction"
else:
    # if the formula in the hypothesis does not contradict the one in the premise, we can infer entailment
