# Premise: If the next three flights departed on-time, how many subsequent flights need to depart from Phoenix on-time, for the airport's on-time departure rate to be higher than 70%? I will see what is the quickest way to solve it then I will provide the explanation.
# Hypothesis: If the next three flights departed on-time, how many subsequent flights need to depart from Phoenix on-time, for the airport's on-time departure rate to be higher than more than 70%? I will see what is the quickest way to solve it then I will provide the explanation.
# Golden Label: contradiction

# Both the premise and the hypothesis are talking about the same situation
# They are identical, except for a repetition in the hypothesis ("higher than more than 70%")
# There are no numerical quantities to compare in this case, as both sentences are identical
# Therefore, the label is 'entailment'

label = "entailment"
