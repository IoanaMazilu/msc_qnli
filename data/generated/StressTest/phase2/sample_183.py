# Premise: How many jelly beans must Dante give to Aaron to ensure that no child has more than 1 fewer jelly beans than any other child?
# Hypothesis: How many jelly beans must Dante give to Aaron to ensure that no child has more than less than 4 fewer jelly beans than any other child?
# Golden Label: entailment

# There are no numerical entities in the sentences. 
# The sentences are questions and do not provide any numerical information. 
# The only comparison that can be made is on the textual information in the premise and the hypothesis. 
# Since they differ, we can infer that the relation is neutral.
