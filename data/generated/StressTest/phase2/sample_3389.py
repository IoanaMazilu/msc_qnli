# Premise: The product of all the possible units digits of Sophie Germain primes greater than 4 is.
# Hypothesis: The product of all the possible units digits of Sophie Germain primes greater than less than 4 is.
# Golden Label: contradiction

# The premise and the hypothesis are not logically connected, 
# as they refer to different sets of Sophie Germain primes (greater than 4 vs less than 4)
# Therefore, no numerical comparison can be performed, and the relationship is neutral
label = "neutral"
