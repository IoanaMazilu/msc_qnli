# Premise: At a meeting of the 9 Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of Naval Operations does not want to sit next to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau.
# Hypothesis: At a meeting of the more than 9 Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of Naval Operations does not want to sit next to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau.
# Golden Label: contradiction
