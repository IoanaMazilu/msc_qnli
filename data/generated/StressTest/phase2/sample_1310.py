# Premise: If there are 10 Pens, the number of Markers in Jenna's desk is :
# Hypothesis: If there are 80 Pens, the number of Markers in Jenna's desk is :
# Golden Label: contradiction

pens_premise = 10
pens_hypothesis = 80

# the hypothesis refers to the number of pens mentioned in the premise
# however, it does not provide a specific number for markers related to the number of pens
# thus, we do not have enough information to compare the premise and hypothesis
# hence, the relation is neutral
