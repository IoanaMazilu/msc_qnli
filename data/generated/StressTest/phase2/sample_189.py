# Premise: If the ratio between the one-third age of Neelam and half of Shaan's age of 5:9, then what is the school age of Shaan?
# Hypothesis: If the ratio between the one-third age of Neelam and half of Shaan's age of less than 6:9, then what is the school age of Shaan?
# Golden Label: entailment

# Defining the ratio of ages in the premise and hypothesis
ratio_premise = 5 / 9
ratio_hypothesis = 6 / 9

# the hypothesis refers to the ratio of ages mentioned in the premise

else:
