# Premise: What will be Sona's age after 6 years?
# Hypothesis: What will be Sona's age after 2 years?
# Golden Label: contradiction

years_future_premise = 6
years_future_hypothesis = 2

# both the premise and hypothesis refer to the future age of Sona, but at different years in the future
# there is no explicit numerical value given for Sona's current age or future age in either statement, only the years in the future are mentioned
# therefore, no direct comparison or calculation can be made between the two statements
# the premise and hypothesis are discussing different time points in the future, so the hypothesis cannot be entailed from or contradict the premise
