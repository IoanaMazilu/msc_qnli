# The hypothesis asserts that the drop in sales was the biggest in the same period of 9 months, without providing a value for the drop.
# Without a numerical value in the hypothesis for the drop, we can't compare it with the drop in the premise.
# Since the drop in the premise is the biggest in 9 months, the hypothesis is consistent with the premise, but it cannot be explicitly entailed from the premise.
