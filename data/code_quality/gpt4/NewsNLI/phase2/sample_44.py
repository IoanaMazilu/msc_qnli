# both premise and hypothesis refer to the same situation
# but the premise specifies the person as 'Noh' while hypothesis refers to him as 'Korean'
# hence, variables are not needed in this case as there are no numerical entities for comparison purposes

# since the identity of the person is not explicitly defined in the hypothesis, we infer neutrality
