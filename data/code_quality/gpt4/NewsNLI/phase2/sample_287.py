# As there are no numerical entities mentioned in the premise or in the hypothesis, there are no variables to define.

# The hypothesis mentions the size of a garbage patch, which is also mentioned in the premise.
# However, the description of the patch (as being trashy or as being a garbage patch) does not affect the size mentioned, so we don't need to compare anything.
# Since the description does not contradict the premise and the size given in the hypothesis is the same as in the premise, we can infer entailment.
