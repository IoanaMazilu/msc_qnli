# the hypothesis mentions the percentage of teens who never exchange e-mail, which is not referenced in the premise
# the premise talks about the percentages of teens who never text their friends and who do not have a cell phone.
# there is no relation or comparison possible between these two distinct behaviors (texting and emailing), and different groups (those without a cell phone and those who never email)
# so the relation is neutral
