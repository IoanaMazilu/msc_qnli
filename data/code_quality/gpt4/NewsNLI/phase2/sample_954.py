# The premise and the hypothesis both mention the two sisters.
# However, the premise talks about Ruiz being suspected of killing them, while the hypothesis mentions that the boyfriend had the most contact with them.
# It's unclear whether Ruiz and the boyfriend are the same person, so we cannot infer entailment or contradiction.
