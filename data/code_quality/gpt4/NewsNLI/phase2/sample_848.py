# The premise does not provide any numerical entities, so no variables are defined.

# The premise mentions an Indian driver who is part of the Formula One grid, suggesting that there is a lot of interest in the sport. 
# The hypothesis also talks about an Indian Formula One driver who believes the race can boost the sport's popularity.
# However, the premise does not explicitly state that the race can boost the sport's popularity, which is what the hypothesis claims, so we cannot entail this from the premise.
