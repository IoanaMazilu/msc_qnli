# the hypothesis talks about the reduction in tin production costs in Indonesia
# the premise also mentions a 25% reduction in production costs for the state-owned tin mine
# However, it does not explicitly state that the whole of Indonesia's tin industry has had the same cost reduction
# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment, but there is also no contradiction
