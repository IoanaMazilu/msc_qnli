# based on the premise and the hypothesis, the variables are not specific numbers 
# but the conditions in which they exist. Therefore, we cannot extract numerical entities
# to define variables.

# the premise and the hypothesis are talking about the same digits X, Y and Z
# but the conditions are different: in the premise, 7 XYZ is a 4-digit number divisible by 2
# and in the hypothesis, 3 XYZ is a 4-digit number divisible by 2

# since the conditions in which the digits X, Y and Z exist are different in the premise and the hypothesis
# we can't infer entailment or contradiction, but we can say the relation is neutral

label = "neutral"
