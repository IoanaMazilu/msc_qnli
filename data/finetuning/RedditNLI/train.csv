We then define a Python function that takes these extracted quantities and checks if the hypothesis contradicts or is neutral to the premise.

The premise states that Goldman is to pay up to $5 billion to settle claims. The hypothesis contradicts this by stating that Goldman Sachs is to pay $5.1 billion to settle a similar claim. As the amount mentioned in the hypothesis is greater than the one in the premise, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. The function hence returns False. The function does not return None (indicating neutrality) because the hypothesis is not independent of the premise; it contradicts it.","
