You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

ratio_hypothesis = 0.06

# the hypothesis and premise mention the ratio of investors hopeful that inflation will decrease
# however, the hypothesis links the ratio to american investors, which cannot be entitles from the premise

START_EXAMPLE
Possible labels: entailment, contradiction, neutral
Premise: The top 5 companies in S&P500 make up in earnings more than 60% of the total valuation of start-ups in the US.
Hypothesis: The top 5 companies in S&P500 make up in earnings more than 70% of the total valuation of start-ups in the US.
Answer:```python
number_companies_premise = 5
number_companies_hypothesis = 5
percentage_of_valuation_premise = 60
percentage_of_valuation_hypothesis = 70

# the hypothesis and premise mention a selection of companies from S&P500 and how much of the total US start-up value they represent
if number_companies_premise != number_companies_hypothesis:
    # check if the number of companies in the hypothesis contradicts the number of companies in the premise
    label = ""contradiction""
elif percentage_of_valuation_hypothesis < min_percentage_of_valuation_premise:
    # check if the estimated percentage of the total valuation in the hypothesis contradicts the premise estimate of more than 'percentage_of_valuation_premise'
    label = ""contradiction""
else:
    # the premise gives only an estimate for the percentage of the valuation
    # any estimate of the percentage in the hypothesis greater or equal to 'percentage_of_valuation_premise' is consistent with the premise, but cannot be explicitly entailed from the premise
    label = ""neutral""

print(label)
