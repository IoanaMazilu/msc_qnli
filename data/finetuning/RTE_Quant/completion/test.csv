You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.
