This directory contains the data for fine-tuning.
For each dataset we have 3 splits.
The test splits are compatible with those from LILA.
The ratio is 70-10-20 for train-validation-test.
The `completion` directory contains the datasets that will be loaded for fine-tuning, with 2 columns: prompt and
completion.
