In the above python script, the function `entailment_or_contradiction` takes three arguments - the number of tables, the number of guests each table can hold (both from the premise), and the total number of guests (from the hypothesis). It computes the total number of guests that can be invited based on the premise and checks if it matches the number from the hypothesis. If they match, the function returns True indicating that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. If they don't, it returns False indicating a contradiction.","

In this script, we first extract the individual quantities from the premise and the hypothesis. We then define a Python function that takes these quantities as arguments. Inside the function, we compute the total calories in the premise by multiplying the calories per candy bar by the number of candy bars. Finally, we compare the total calories in the premise with the total calories in the hypothesis. If they are equal, the function returns True, indicating that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating a contradiction.","

We also define the net amount that Mike spent according to the hypothesis.

In the above Python script, we first extract the individual quantities from the premise and the hypothesis. We then define a function that takes these quantities as arguments.

Finally, we compare this computed total with the total number of peaches mentioned in the hypothesis. If they are equal, the function returns True, indicating entailment; otherwise, it returns False, indicating contradiction.","

Explanation: 

The premise states that Sarah received 108 pieces of candy, ate 36 pieces, and then divided the remaining candy into piles of 9 pieces each. This implies that the number of piles she made is equal to the remaining candy divided by the number of pieces per pile. The hypothesis states that she made 4 piles. 

The entailment or contradiction is determined by comparing the number of piles calculated from the premise and the number of piles stated in the hypothesis. If they are equal, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. If they are not equal, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. In this case, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as the number of piles calculated from the premise (8 piles) is equal to the number of piles stated in the hypothesis (4 piles).","
