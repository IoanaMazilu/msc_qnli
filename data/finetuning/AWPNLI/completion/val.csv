You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:
