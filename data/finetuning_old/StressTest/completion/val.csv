You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None.

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None.

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used.

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:
START_EXAMPLE
Premise: He sold $200-worth of cookies at the school fair.

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship.

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails, contradicts or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs,as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, first check if the hypothesis facts or quantities contradict the premise ones. If there is no contradiction, check if all the hypothesis quantities and details entail the premise information. If you need to, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. Thecomparison should use operators inferred from the context and quantifiers, if any are used. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False, and for neutrality return None. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:
