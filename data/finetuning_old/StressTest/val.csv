In the above Python script, we first extract the ratio of distances between A to B and B to C from both the premise and the hypothesis, and store them in 'ratio_AB_BC_premise' and 'ratio_AB_BC_hypothesis' respectively. We then define a function 'entailment_or_contradiction_or_neutral' which checks whether the ratio from the hypothesis is lower or equal to the ratio from the premise. If it is, the function returns False indicating a contradiction. If not, the function returns None indicating neutrality. The script then calls this function with the extracted ratio values and prints the result.","

- The hypothesis states that the difference is less than 65, while the premise states that the difference is less than 15.
- Therefore, if the difference stated in the hypothesis is less than the difference stated in the premise, it would contradict the premise. Hence, we check if 'average_marks_diff_hypothesis' is less than 'average_marks_diff_premise'. If it is, we return False indicating a contradiction.
- If 'average_marks_diff_hypothesis' is not less than 'average_marks_diff_premise', then the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and instead entails it. Hence, we return True.","

This Python script first extracts the radius of echina from both the premise and the hypothesis.

If the premise radius is less than or equal to the hypothesis minimum, it returns False, indicating a contradiction. Else, it returns True, indicating entailment, as any radius greater than 1mm does not contradict the hypothesis.","
