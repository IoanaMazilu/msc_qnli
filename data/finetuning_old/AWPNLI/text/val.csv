"### Instruction:
You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:
START_EXAMPLE
Premise: Yesterday I learned 35 verbs and 5 nouns in the morning and 10 verbs in the evening.
Hypothesis: I learned 5 nouns and less than fifty verbs yesterday.
Answer:
```python
verbs_morning_premise = 35
verbs_evening_premise = 10
nouns_premise = 5
max_verbs_hypothesis = 50 
nouns_hypothesis = 5

def entailment_or_contradiction(verbs_morning_premise, verbs_evening_premise, nouns_premise, max_verbs_hypothesis, nouns_hypothesis):
    # the hypothesis talks about the number of learned nouns and verbs, which are also referenced in the premise
    # find the total number of verbs learned from the premise 
    total_verbs_premise = verbs_morning_premise + verbs_evening_premise
    # check if the total verbs form the hypothesis is more than 'verbs_evening_premise' and if the number of nouns is equal between the premise and hypothesis
    return max_verbs_hypothesis > total_verbs_premise and nouns_premise == nouns_hypothesis

print(entailment_or_contradiction(verbs_morning_premise, verbs_evening_premise, nouns_premise, max_verbs_hypothesis, nouns_hypothesis))

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis.

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

### Input:
Premise: There are 3.0 calories in a candy bar.
Hypothesis: 18.0 calories are there in 5.0 candy bars
### Response:
```python
calories_per_candy_premise = 3.0
total_calories_hypothesis = 18.0
number_of_candy_hypothesis = 5.0

    total_calories_premise = calories_per_candy_premise * number_of_candy_hypothesis
    # check if 'total_calories_hypothesis' entails the quantity deduced from the premise, so if they are equal
    return total_calories_premise == total_calories_hypothesis

"### Instruction:
You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or contradicts a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should be entailed by the information in the premise. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, use these quantities to perform computations based on the context of the premise and hypothesis. Finally, compare the resulting variables to determine the relationship. If the comparison indicates entailment, return True; for contradiction return False. Remember to include brief comments in the script to explain each step of the reasoning process. To illustrate, consider the following examples:
START_EXAMPLE
Premise: Yesterday I learned 35 verbs and 5 nouns in the morning and 10 verbs in the evening.
Hypothesis: I learned 5 nouns and less than fifty verbs yesterday.
Answer:
```python
verbs_morning_premise = 35
verbs_evening_premise = 10
nouns_premise = 5
max_verbs_hypothesis = 50 
nouns_hypothesis = 5

def entailment_or_contradiction(verbs_morning_premise, verbs_evening_premise, nouns_premise, max_verbs_hypothesis, nouns_hypothesis):
    # the hypothesis talks about the number of learned nouns and verbs, which are also referenced in the premise
    # find the total number of verbs learned from the premise 
    total_verbs_premise = verbs_morning_premise + verbs_evening_premise
    # check if the total verbs form the hypothesis is more than 'verbs_evening_premise' and if the number of nouns is equal between the premise and hypothesis
    return max_verbs_hypothesis > total_verbs_premise and nouns_premise == nouns_hypothesis

print(entailment_or_contradiction(verbs_morning_premise, verbs_evening_premise, nouns_premise, max_verbs_hypothesis, nouns_hypothesis))
```

Premise: She bought 10 crayons and received 5 more from her desk mate.
Hypothesis: She has 10 crayons in total.
Answer:
```python
bought_crayons_premise = 10
received_crayons_premise = 5
total_crayons_hypothesis = 12

def entailment_or_contradiction(bought_crayons_premise, received_crayons_premise, total_crayons_hypothesis):
    # the entity in the hypothesis can be computed from the entities in the premise
    total_crayons_premise = bought_crayons_premise + received_crayons_premise
    # check if 'total_crayons_hypothesis' entails the quantity deduced from the premise, so if they are equal
    return total_crayons_premise == total_crayons_hypothesis:

### Input:
Premise: Wendy uploaded 79.0 pictures to Facebook on Monday and she uploaded 44.0 pictures to Facebook on Tuesday, then split all the pictures into 5.0 different albums
Hypothesis: 20.1 pictures were in each album
### Response:
```python
pictures_uploaded_monday_premise = 79.0
pictures_uploaded_tuesday_premise = 44.0
albums_premise = 5.0
pictures_per_album_hypothesis = 20.1

def entailment_or_contradiction(pictures_uploaded_monday_premise, pictures_uploaded_tuesday_premise, albums_premise, pictures_per_album_hypothesis):
    # the hypothesis talks about the number of pictures per album, which can be computed from the premise
    total_pictures_premise = pictures_uploaded_monday_premise + pictures_uploaded_tuesday_premise
    # compute the number of pictures per album from the premise
    pictures_per_album_premise = total_pictures_premise / albums_premise
    # the hypothesis entails the premise if the computed number of pictures per album is equal between the premise and hypothesis
    return pictures_per_album_premise == pictures_per_album_hypothesis
