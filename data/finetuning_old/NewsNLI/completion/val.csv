You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

Premise: The 3 performers wore outfits inspired by the Spanish culture.
Hypothesis: The outfits of the 3 performers were in the colors of Spain's flag. 
Answer:
```python
performers_premise = 3
performers_hypothesis = 3

def entailment_or_neutral(performers_premise, performers_hypothesis):
    # the hypothesis mentions a number of performers and their outfits, which are also referenced in the premise
    # however, outfits being inspired by the spanish culture does not necessarily mean they were in the colors of the Spanish flag
    # as the extra details in the hypothesis cannot be entailed from the premise, the hypothesis is neutral to the premise
    return None

print(entailment_or_neutral(performers_premise, performers_hypothesis))

budget_hypothesis = 2e6

def entailment_or_neutral(budget_premise, budget_hypothesis):
    # both the hypothesis and premise mention Amsterdam's budget for green energy, but the hypothesis suggests Amsterdam was already the leading city in terms of sustainability, which is not clear from the premise 
    # as the hypothesis gives details that cannot be fully entailed from the premise, it is neutral to it
    return None
