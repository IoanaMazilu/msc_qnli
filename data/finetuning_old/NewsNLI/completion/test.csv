You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You need to reason about weather a hypothesis entails or is neutral with respect to a premise, by generating Python scripts. The scripts should classify the relation between the hypothesis and premise based on the quantitative and textual information mentioned in them. All the quantities and textual details in the hypothesis should entail the information in the premise. Pay attention to the wording of the hypothesis, as it may indicate details which cannot be entailed from the premise directly. First, manually extract all the individual quantities from both of the inputs, as valid numbers. Use the variable name to describe what the quantity measures, based on the context. Then, define a Python function that takes the extracted quantities as arguments. Within the function, reason as to weather the quantities in the hypothesis refer to the same entities as those in the premise. If they don't, then return None for neutrality. If they do, compare them and return True if the hypothesis values entail those in the premise, or None otherwise. To illustrate, consider the following examples:
