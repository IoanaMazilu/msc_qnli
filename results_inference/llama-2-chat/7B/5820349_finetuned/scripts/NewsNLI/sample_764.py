# There are no numerical entities in the premise to define variables for
# However, the hypothesis mentions the number of women in France who wear the full veil
# We can define a variable for this number and compare it with the hypothesis
full_veil_women_hypothesis = 2000

# However, the premise does not provide any information about the number of women who wear the full veil
# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction based on this variable
