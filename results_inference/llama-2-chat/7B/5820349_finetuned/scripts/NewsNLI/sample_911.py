# There are no numerical entities in the premise or the hypothesis

# The premise mentions a specific event (win in Dubai) that would lead to a certain status for Stenson
# The hypothesis also mentions a specific event (shooting an eight-under-par 64) that would lead to a certain status for Stenson
# However, the hypothesis does not mention the specific status or the Race to Dubai, which are mentioned in the premise
# Therefore, the premise and the hypothesis do not contradict each other, but the hypothesis cannot be fully entailed from the premise
