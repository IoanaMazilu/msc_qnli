% entailment, contradiction, neutral
Premise: Never forget the USA is the best in everything... except for the part where 50% of children and 90% of black children need government assistance to eat.
Hypothesis: The US is quickly becoming a 3rd world country. 50% of all children and 90% of black children need government assistance to eat.

# define variables for the premise and hypothesis
premise_children = 50
premise_black_children = 90

# check if the number of children in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
if premise_children!= hypothesis_children:
    label = "contradiction"
else:
    # check if the number of black children in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    if premise_black_children!= hypothesis_black_children:
        label = "contradiction"
    else:
        # if the number of children and black children in the hypothesis do not contradict the premise, we can infer entailment
        label = "entailment"
