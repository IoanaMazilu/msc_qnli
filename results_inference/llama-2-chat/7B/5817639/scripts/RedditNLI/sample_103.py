# Extract information from the premise and hypothesis
# The premise mentions that Mexico raised its key rate for the first time since 2008, after the Fed
# The hypothesis mentions that Hong Kong raised its base rate for the first time since 2006, after the Fed
# We can infer that the rate mentioned in the hypothesis is not the same as the rate mentioned in the premise

# Compare the rates in the premise and hypothesis

    # Check if the rate in the hypothesis contradicts the rate in the premise

else:
    # If the rates are the same, we can infer entailment
