# Define variables for the numerical entities in the input sentences
premise_distance = 50e3  # distance in km
premise_building_height = 35e3  # height in km
premise_wonder = 7
hypothesis_wonder = 7

# Extract all quantities as valid numbers
distance_hypothesis = hypothesis_wonder * premise_distance
building_height_hypothesis = hypothesis_wonder * premise_building_height

# Use brief comments to explain the comparison between the defined variables
# For example, if we compare two numbers using the comparison operator ">=", we would write a comment like "the hypothesis building height is greater than or equal to the premise building height"
# Similarly, if we compare two numbers using the comparison operator ">", we would write a comment like "the hypothesis building height is greater than the premise building height"

# Compare the variables to infer the label
