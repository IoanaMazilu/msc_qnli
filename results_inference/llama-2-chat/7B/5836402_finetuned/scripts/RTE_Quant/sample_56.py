# No numerical entities in the premise or hypothesis, so no variables to define.
# The premise and hypothesis both mention the same event of dynamite attacks in a Northwestern Colombian city,
# but the premise mentions two injured persons, while the hypothesis does not mention anything about the number of injured persons.
# Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be entailed from the premise, since the number of injured persons is unknown.
