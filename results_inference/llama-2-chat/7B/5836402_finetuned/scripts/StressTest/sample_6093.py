# There are no numerical entities in the premise or the hypothesis, so we cannot define variables.
# However, we can compare the statements based on their meaning.

# The premise states that the product of all possible units digits of Sophie Germain primes greater than 9 is.
# The hypothesis states that the product of all possible units digits of Sophie Germain primes greater than more than 8 is.

# Comparing the two statements, we can see that the first statement refers to a product of more than 9, while the second statement refers to a product of more than 8.
# Since 9 is greater than 8, the hypothesis cannot be entailed from the premise.
