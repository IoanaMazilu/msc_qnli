# There are no numerical entities in the premise or the hypothesis to compare. Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction based on numerical values.
# However, the hypothesis mentions the same topic (ethical questions) and the same type of sites (open-source anti-bribe sites) as the premise.
# Therefore, we can infer neutrality.
