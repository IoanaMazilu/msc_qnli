# the premise and hypothesis both mention the bombing incidents in Karbala and Baghdad

# the premise does not provide any information about the number of bombs in Baghdad,
# so we cannot infer entailment or contradiction from the premise alone
# the hypothesis specifies one bomb in Baghdad, which is not mentioned in the premise
# hence, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction from the hypothesis either
