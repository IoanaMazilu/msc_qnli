# The premise and hypothesis both mention the number of gunshots detected by a forensic audio expert
# However, the premise provides more details on the number of clusters of gunshots detected
# The hypothesis only mentions the total number of gunshots

# We can infer entailment since the hypothesis does not contradict the premise's details
