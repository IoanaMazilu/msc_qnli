# The premise and hypothesis both mention Danny Welbeck scoring a hat-trick in a match between Arsenal and Galatasaray.

# The premise specifically states that this is Danny Welbeck's first hat-trick for Arsenal, while the hypothesis does not make any such claim.
# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction based on this premise and hypothesis.

# However, we can infer neutrality, as both the premise and hypothesis describe the same event.
