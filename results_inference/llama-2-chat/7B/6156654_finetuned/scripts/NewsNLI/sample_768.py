# The premise and hypothesis are the same, so we can infer entailment
label = "entailment"

# The premise and hypothesis are comparing the speed of cooking with traditional utensils, which is also mentioned in the hypothesis
# However, the hypothesis provides no specific information about the speed of cooking, only that it is faster than traditional utensils
# This means that the hypothesis is not more specific than the premise, but it also does not contradict it
# Therefore, we can infer entailment
