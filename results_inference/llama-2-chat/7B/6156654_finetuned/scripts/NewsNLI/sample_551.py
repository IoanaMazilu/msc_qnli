# The premise and hypothesis are both referring to the same soccer match between the United States and Slovenia.

# The premise states that the United States came back from a 2-goal deficit to draw 2-2 with Slovenia.
# The hypothesis states that Slovenia topped the group after an earlier 2-2 draw with the United States.

# Since the premise and hypothesis do not contradict each other, we can infer entailment.
