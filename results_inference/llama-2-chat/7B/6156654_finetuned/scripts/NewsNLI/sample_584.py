# The premise and hypothesis both mention Djokovic winning the Australian Open and claiming five titles.
# However, the premise provides more context and details about the match, including the score and the opponent.

# Since the hypothesis does not mention the details of the match, it cannot be explicitly entailed from the premise.
# However, the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, as both mention the same event and outcome.
