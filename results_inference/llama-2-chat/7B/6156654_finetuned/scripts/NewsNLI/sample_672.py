# The premise mentions the amount of snowfall at O'Hare Airport and Urbana, Illinois
# The hypothesis mentions the amount of snowfall at O'Hare Airport and Detroit

# The premise does not mention the amount of snowfall in Detroit, so it cannot be entailed from the premise
# However, the premise and hypothesis both mention the amount of snowfall at O'Hare Airport, which is the same
# Therefore, we can infer neutral from the premise and hypothesis
