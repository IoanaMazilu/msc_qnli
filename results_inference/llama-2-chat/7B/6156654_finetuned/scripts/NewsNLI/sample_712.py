# The premise and hypothesis both mention the value of the souvenirs and their origin, which are the same.
# The hypothesis, however, adds a specific context for why the souvenirs are not allowed to be sold, which is not explicitly mentioned in the premise.
# Therefore, we cannot fully entail the hypothesis from the premise, but it is a possible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
