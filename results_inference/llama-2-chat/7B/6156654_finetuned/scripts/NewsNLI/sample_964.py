# The premise and hypothesis are not related, so we can't infer entailment, contradiction, or neutral.

# The premise mentions a number (42) that appears on a shirt, while the hypothesis refers to an estimated budget for a movie version.
# These two pieces of information are not related, so we cannot infer any connection between them.

# Therefore, we cannot determine if the hypothesis entails, contradicts, or is neutral to the premise.
