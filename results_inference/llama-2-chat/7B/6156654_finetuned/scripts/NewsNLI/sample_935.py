# There are no numerical entities in the premise or hypothesis, so we cannot perform any numerical comparisons.
# However, we can still compare the content of the premise and hypothesis using the keywords and phrases.

# The premise and hypothesis mention fatalities and infant deaths, which are both related to the recliners.
# However, the premise specifically mentions the Generation Two model and Nap Nanny Chill recliner, while the hypothesis does not provide any specific recliner models.
# Therefore, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise.
