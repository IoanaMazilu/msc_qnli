# The premise and hypothesis are both referring to Jillian Meredith McCabe
# The premise mentions her age, arrest charges and bail amount
# The hypothesis mentions her bail amount

# The premise does not mention the bail amount explicitly, but it can be inferred
# The hypothesis mentions the bail amount, which is also mentioned in the premise

# We can infer that the bail amount in the hypothesis is the same as the bail amount in the premise
# However, the hypothesis does not provide any additional information about the bail amount
# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction from the hypothesis
