# the premise and hypothesis are both talking about the unemployment rate in Perry County, Kentucky
# the premise mentions the specific county seat of Hazard in Perry County
# the hypothesis mentions a different unemployment rate for Kentucky

# since the premise does not mention anything about Kentucky, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction
# however, the premise does not rule out the possibility that the unemployment rate in Kentucky is 11.1%
# therefore, we can label this as neutral

label = "neutral"
