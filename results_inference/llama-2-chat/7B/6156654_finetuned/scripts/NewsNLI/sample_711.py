# The premise and hypothesis both mention the amount of money Wheeler is accused of stealing
# However, the premise provides more context and details about the nature of the theft,
# including the fact that the money was awarded to him on applications and submissions of documents
# that were based on lies and reproductions of other people's hard work.

# The hypothesis only mentions the amount of money, without providing any additional context.

# Since the premise provides more information than the hypothesis, we cannot infer entailment.
