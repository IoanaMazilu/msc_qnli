# The premise and hypothesis both refer to the number of cartograms in the book

# The hypothesis mentions specific topics (disease, wealth, poverty, and the environment)
# that are not explicitly mentioned in the premise

# Since the premise does not provide any information about the topics in the hypothesis,
# we cannot infer entailment or contradiction
