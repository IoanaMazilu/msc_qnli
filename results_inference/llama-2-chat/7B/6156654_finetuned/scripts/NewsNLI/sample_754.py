# The premise and hypothesis mention the number of people detained or arrested by Turkish authorities
# However, the premise provides more specific information about the location of those detained (connection with the protests)
# The hypothesis does not provide any information about the location of those arrested

# Since the premise provides more specific information than the hypothesis, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction
# However, we can infer neutrality, as both statements mention the number of people arrested or detained without specifying their location
