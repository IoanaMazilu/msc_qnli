# The premise and hypothesis do not have any numerical entities,
# so we cannot perform any numerical comparisons.

# However, we can compare the entities in the premise and hypothesis.
# The premise mentions "He came in and already knows how to beat me in this game,"
# which implies that there is a game being referred to.
# The hypothesis does not mention any specific game.

# Based on this, we can infer that the hypothesis does not entail or contradict the premise,
# as there is no game mentioned in the hypothesis.
