# The premise and hypothesis both mention Lee Slattery's lead in strokes, so we can compare them directly.

# The premise mentions Lee Slattery's lead as two strokes, while the hypothesis mentions a lead of two strokes.
# Since the hypothesis values and the premise values are the same, we can infer entailment.
