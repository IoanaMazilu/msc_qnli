# The premise and hypothesis both mention the death of Robert Enke, a goalkeeper for Hannover and Germany, from an apparent suicide.

# The premise does not provide any additional information about the death, such as the location or time.
# The hypothesis provides more specific information about the death, including the location and time.

# Since the premise and hypothesis both mention the death of Robert Enke from an apparent suicide, but the hypothesis provides more specific information, we can infer entailment.
