# The premise and hypothesis refer to the average speed of Murali from A to C,
# which is also mentioned in both the premise and hypothesis.

# The premise gives a specific ratio of distances between A to B and B to C,
# which is used to calculate the average speed in the premise.
# The hypothesis gives a general ratio of distances between A to B and B to C,
# which is more than the ratio given in the premise.

# Since the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, we can infer entailment.
