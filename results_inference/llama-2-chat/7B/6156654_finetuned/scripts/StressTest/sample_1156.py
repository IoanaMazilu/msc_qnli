# The premise gives the number of airline passengers traveling to or from the United States in less than 2979,
# while the hypothesis refers to the same number in 1979

# the premise does not provide a specific year for the passengers' travel, so we cannot directly compare it to the year in the hypothesis
# the number of passengers in the premise is the same as in the hypothesis, but the year is different

# therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction based on this comparison alone
