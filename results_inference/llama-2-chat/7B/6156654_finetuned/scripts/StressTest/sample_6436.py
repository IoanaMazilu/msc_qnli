# The hypothesis refers to the same work conditions as the premise

# The hypothesis mentions the hourly wage and the tip rate, which are also mentioned in the premise
# However, the hypothesis gives a different percentage for the tip rate

# We can't directly entail the hypothesis from the premise because the tip rate is not explicitly mentioned in the premise
# However, we can infer that the tip rate in the hypothesis is less than 75% because it's less than the tip rate in the premise

# Since the premise and the hypothesis refer to the same work conditions and the tip rate in the hypothesis is less than the tip rate in the premise, we can infer entailment
