# The premise and hypothesis are the same, except for the time period
# The premise mentions that Ayisha's father's age will be twice Shankar's age after 10 years
# The hypothesis mentions that Ayisha's father's age will be twice Shankar's age after 30 years

# Since the time period in the hypothesis is greater than the time period in the premise,
# we can infer entailment
