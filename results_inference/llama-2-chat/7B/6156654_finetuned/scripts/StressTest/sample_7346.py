# The premise and hypothesis mention the same price change percentage for crude oil, which is 5%.
# However, the premise mentions a price change of 28% in the last 3 months, while the hypothesis mentions a price change of more than 28%.
# Since the hypothesis mentions a greater price change than the premise, we cannot infer entailment.
# Therefore, we will label this as neutral.
