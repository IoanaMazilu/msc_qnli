# the hypothesis refers to the time when Anita goes away and Indu leaves, which is also mentioned in the premise
# the hypothesis also states that Indu leaves more than 1 day before the work is finished, which is not mentioned in the premise

# however, the hypothesis does not entail any specific information about the time when Anita goes away and Indu leaves, which is why we cannot infer entailment
