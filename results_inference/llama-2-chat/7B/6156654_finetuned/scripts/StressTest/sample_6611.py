# the hypothesis talks about Molly's age in more than 18 years, which is not explicitly mentioned in the premise
# the premise mentions Molly's age in 18 years and 7 years ago, but does not provide a specific upper bound for Molly's age
# therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction from the premise alone
