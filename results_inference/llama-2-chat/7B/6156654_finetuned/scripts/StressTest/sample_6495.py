# The premise gives a specific time for the journey (44 min), while the hypothesis gives a time estimate greater than 24 min
# The average speed of the bus is the same in both premise and hypothesis

# The hypothesis states that the bus reached Pune in more than 24 min, which is contradictory to the premise which states that the bus reached Pune in 44 min
