# The premise and hypothesis both refer to Jerry's score on the fourth test and the required score to raise his average by a certain amount.
# The hypothesis states that Jerry must earn a score of 2 points to raise his average by 2 points.
# The premise states that Jerry must earn a score of less than 7 points to raise his average by less than 7 points.
# We can infer from the premise that Jerry's score on the fourth test is less than 7 points, which is also stated in the hypothesis.
# Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are neutral.
