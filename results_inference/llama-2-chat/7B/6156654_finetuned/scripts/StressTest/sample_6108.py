# The premise and hypothesis both refer to the percentage of college graduates in Amtek's sales staff

# The premise states that level-1 college graduates account for 15% of Amtek's sales staff
# The hypothesis states that level-less than 4 college graduates account for 15% of Amtek's sales staff

# The hypothesis cannot be entailed from the premise, as it refers to a different level of education
# The premise does not contradict the hypothesis, as the percentage of college graduates in the sales staff is the same in both cases
# The hypothesis is neutral, as it does not make any claims about the percentage of college graduates in Amtek's sales staff
