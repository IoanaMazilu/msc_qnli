# The premise gives the maximum number of boxes of cigarettes in one case
boxes_per_case = 8

# The hypothesis gives the number of boxes of cigarettes in one case
boxes_per_case = 5

# If the number of boxes in one case is less than 8, then the number of cases Kramer can pack in 2 hours is not explicitly mentioned in the premise
# However, the hypothesis gives a specific number of boxes per case that contradicts the premise
# Therefore, the relation between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral
