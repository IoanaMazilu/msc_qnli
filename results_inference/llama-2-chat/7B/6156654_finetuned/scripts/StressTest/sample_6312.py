# The premise and hypothesis refer to the same scenario, but with different numbers of males and females.

# The hypothesis refers to more than 2 males and 3 females, which is not explicitly mentioned in the premise.
# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction from the premise alone.

# However, since the premise does not explicitly mention any males or females, we can infer neutral.
