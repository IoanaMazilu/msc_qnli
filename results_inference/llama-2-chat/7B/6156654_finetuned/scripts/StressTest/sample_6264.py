# The premise and hypothesis are about the same event, but the hypothesis is more specific.

# The hypothesis talks about Dan working alone for more than 2 hours, which is not explicitly mentioned in the premise.
# However, since the premise does not mention any specific time for Dan's work, we can infer that Dan worked alone for more than 2 hours.

# Therefore, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but rather expands on it.
