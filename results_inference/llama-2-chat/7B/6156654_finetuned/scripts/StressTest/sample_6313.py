# The premise and hypothesis both refer to the number of ways for people to sit around a circular table, with some restrictions on the gender of the individuals.
# The hypothesis refers to a specific combination of males and females, while the premise refers to any combination of more than 2 males and 3 females.
# The hypothesis also states that Mary wants to sit with her back on the wall, which is not mentioned in the premise.

# The hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as the premise does not provide any specific information about the number of males and females sitting around the table.
# The premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the hypothesis provides a specific combination of males and females that contradicts the premise's open-endedness.
# Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is neutral.
