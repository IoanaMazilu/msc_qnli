# The premise and hypothesis are both dealing with the same event
# and are comparing the age of a person in the future

# The premise mentions a specific ratio of ages between two people
# and the hypothesis mentions that the person will be more than 5/3 times as old as Tom
# at the same point in the future

# The hypothesis can be entailed from the premise
# since the premise gives a specific ratio and the hypothesis states that the person will be more than that
