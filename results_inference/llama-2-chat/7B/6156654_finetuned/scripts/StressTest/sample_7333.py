# The premise and hypothesis are about the percentage of Samsung and iPhone users in ABC Limited
# The premise mentions the percentage of Samsung and iPhone users in the same company, while the hypothesis also mentions the percentage of Samsung and iPhone users in the same company
# We can infer that the hypothesis refers to the same company as the premise, based on the percentage of Samsung and iPhone users

# The premise states that more than 25% of the people in ABC Limited are using Samsung phones, and 70% are using iPhones
# The hypothesis states that 75% of the people in ABC Limited are using Samsung phones, and 70% are using iPhones

# We can infer that the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, since the percentage of Samsung and iPhone users in the premise and hypothesis are the same
# However, the hypothesis does not entail the premise, since the percentage of Samsung and iPhone users in the premise is not explicitly mentioned
