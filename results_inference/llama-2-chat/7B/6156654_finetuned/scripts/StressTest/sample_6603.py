# The premise and hypothesis mention the same event, but with different investment multiples
# The premise states that Sandy got back 2 times the original investment, while the hypothesis states that Sandy got back less than 3 times the original investment
# Since the hypothesis value is less than the premise value, it does not contradict the premise
# However, the hypothesis value cannot be explicitly entailed from the premise
