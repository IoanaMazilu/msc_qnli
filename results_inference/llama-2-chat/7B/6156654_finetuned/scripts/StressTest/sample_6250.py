# The premise and hypothesis mention the same group of people
# However, the hypothesis mentions a different number of boys and girls

# The hypothesis states that there are 6 boys and 4 girls, while the premise states that there are more than 5 boys and 4 girls
# We cannot entail the hypothesis from the premise, as the number of girls in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
# However, we cannot contradict the hypothesis either, as the number of boys in the hypothesis is consistent with the premise
