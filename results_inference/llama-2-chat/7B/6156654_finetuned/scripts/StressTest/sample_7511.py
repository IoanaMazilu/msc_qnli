# the premise and hypothesis refer to the same journey and driving speeds
# the only difference is the total driving time, which is 7 hours in the hypothesis
# but the premise only mentions 4 hours of driving at 50 mph
# and 3 hours of driving at 60 mph

# we can infer that the driving time in the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise
# but it does not entail the premise either
