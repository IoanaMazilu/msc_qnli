# The premise and hypothesis both refer to the loss Indu would have suffered if she had given the amount to Bindu at a certain interest rate.
# The hypothesis also refers to the duration of the loan, which is not mentioned in the premise.
# Since the duration is not mentioned in the premise, we cannot infer the duration from the premise.
# However, the rate of interest is mentioned in both the premise and the hypothesis, which is the same.
# Therefore, we can infer entailment.
