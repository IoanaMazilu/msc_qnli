# The premise gives us information about the amount of cookies eaten by Michael, Steve, and Tyler
# The hypothesis also gives us information about the amount of cookies eaten by Michael, Steve, and Tyler

# The premise does not contradict the hypothesis, but it does provide additional information
# We can infer that Michael ate more than 1/8 of the cookies, since the hypothesis does not specify the amount
# We can also infer that Steve ate one half, which is consistent with the hypothesis
# We cannot infer the amount of cookies Tyler ate, as the hypothesis does not provide that information
