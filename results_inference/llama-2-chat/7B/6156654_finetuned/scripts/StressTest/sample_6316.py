# The premise and hypothesis both talk about the color code of "YELLOW".
# If the color code of "YELLOW" is greater than 62, then the difference between "BROWN" and "RED" cannot be determined.
# If the color code of "YELLOW" is 92, then the difference between "BROWN" and "RED" can be determined.

# The premise and hypothesis are not contradictory.
# The premise provides more information about the color code of "YELLOW", but does not contradict the hypothesis.
# Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is neutral.
