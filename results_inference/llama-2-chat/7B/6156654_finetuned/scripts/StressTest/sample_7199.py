# The hypothesis refers to the number of interior points on each side of the triangle, which is also mentioned in the premise
# However, the hypothesis gives a different number of points for each side than the premise

# The hypothesis states that the number of interior points on each side of the triangle is 7, 4, and 5, respectively
# The premise states that the number of interior points on each side of the triangle is 3, 4, and 5, respectively

# Since the hypothesis gives a different number of points for each side than the premise, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction
# The hypothesis and premise are neutral towards each other
