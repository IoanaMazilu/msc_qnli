# The premise and hypothesis are both about how much Dana will owe her parents after four years of college
# The hypothesis states that if Dana gives less than 7% of the amount back each month, then she will still owe her parents after four years

# The premise does not mention the percentage of the amount that Dana gives back each month
# However, it does mention that Dana will still owe her parents after four years

# Based on the premise, we cannot infer the percentage of the amount that Dana gives back each month
# Therefore, we cannot entail the hypothesis from the premise
