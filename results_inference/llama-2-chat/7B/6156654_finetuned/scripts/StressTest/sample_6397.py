# The premise and hypothesis are both talking about the proportion of airline passengers using Kennedy Airport.
# The premise gives a specific number for the year "less than 6979", while the hypothesis gives a specific number for the year "1979".
# Since both the premise and hypothesis are referring to the same proportion of airline passengers, but with different specific years, we can infer entailment.

# The hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, so we can mark it as entailment.
