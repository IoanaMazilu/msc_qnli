# the premise and hypothesis are the same, except for the duration of investment
# the premise mentions the duration of investment as less than 7 months, while the hypothesis mentions 6 months
# we can infer that the amount invested by Rick is the same in both cases
# since the premise and hypothesis do not contradict each other, we can infer entailment

# the hypothesis refers to the same investment amount and duration mentioned in the premise
# the premise does not provide any information about the duration of Rick's investment
# we cannot infer any information about the duration of Rick's investment from the premise
# hence, the premise and hypothesis are neutral with respect to the duration of Rick's investment

# the premise and hypothesis mention different durations of investment, which are not contradictory
# we cannot infer any information about the amount invested by Rick from the premise
# hence, the premise and hypothesis are neutral with respect to the amount invested by Rick
