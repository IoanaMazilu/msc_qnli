# The premise and hypothesis are talking about the same thing, so we can compare them

# The hypothesis refers to the percentage of top-10 movie lists that a film must appear in to be considered for movie of the year
# The premise also refers to the percentage of top-10 movie lists, but it does not explicitly mention the minimum percentage

# Since the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, we can infer entailment
