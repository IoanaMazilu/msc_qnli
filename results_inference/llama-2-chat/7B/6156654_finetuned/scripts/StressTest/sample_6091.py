# The hypothesis refers to the definition of a Sophie Germain prime, which is also mentioned in the premise.
# The hypothesis states that a Sophie Germain prime is any positive prime number p for which 2 p + 1 is also prime.
# The premise states that a Sophie Germain prime is any positive prime number p for which less than 3 p + 1 is also prime.

# The hypothesis and premise are not contradictory, as they both define the concept of a Sophie Germain prime.
# However, the hypothesis provides a more specific definition of a Sophie Germain prime, as it specifies the exact value of 2 p + 1 that must be prime.
# Therefore, the relationship between the hypothesis and premise is neutral, as they both provide different definitions of the same concept.
