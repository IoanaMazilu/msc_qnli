# The hypothesis refers to the same definition of a Sophie Germain prime as the premise
# However, the hypothesis specifies a different condition for a Sophie Germain prime

# The hypothesis states that a Sophie Germain prime is any positive prime number p for which 2p + 1 is also prime
# The premise states that a Sophie Germain prime is any positive prime number p for which less than 4p + 1 is also prime

# The hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it does provide a different condition for a Sophie Germain prime
# Therefore, the relation between the hypothesis and the premise is neutral
