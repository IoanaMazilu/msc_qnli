# The hypothesis refers to the same scenario as the premise, but with a different time estimate.

# The premise states that if Anne's speed were doubled, they could clean their house in 3 hours working at their respective rates.
# The hypothesis states that if Anne's speed were doubled, they could clean their house in less than 3 hours working at their respective rates.
# This is a contradiction to the premise, as the hypothesis states a time estimate that is less than the time estimate in the premise.
