# The premise and hypothesis are both talking about the product of units digits of Sophie Germain primes,
# but the premise mentions only primes greater than 9, while the hypothesis mentions primes greater than 8
# The hypothesis cannot be entailed from the premise, since the product of units digits of primes greater than 8 is not the same as the product of units digits of primes greater than 9
# The hypothesis is a specific statement that cannot be deduced from the premise, so we classify it as neutral
