# the premise and hypothesis both refer to the number of different selections Amanda can make from 4 items
# the premise specifies the number of types of balls and board games in the toy store
# the hypothesis specifies a lower limit for the number of types of balls and board games

# the hypothesis cannot be entailed from the premise, as the hypothesis introduces a new limit for the number of types of balls and board games
# the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the premise specifies a number of types that is greater than the limit in the hypothesis
# the hypothesis is neutral, as it does not affect the number of selections Amanda can make
