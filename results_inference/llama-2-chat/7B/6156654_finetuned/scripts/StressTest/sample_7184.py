# The premise and hypothesis provide information about the distribution of passengers by continent of origin
# The hypothesis refers to the number of passengers from North America, Europe, Africa, Asia and other continents
# We need to compare the number of passengers from each continent in the premise and hypothesis

# The premise mentions 1/12 of the passengers are from North America, 1/8 are Europeans, 1/3 are from Africa, 1/6 are from Asia and 35 people are from other continents
# The hypothesis mentions 3/12 of the passengers are from North America, 1/8 are Europeans, 1/3 are from Africa, 1/6 are from Asia and 35 people are from other continents

# We can compare the number of passengers from each continent in the premise and hypothesis
# However, the number of passengers from other continents is the same in both the premise and hypothesis
# So, we can only compare the number of passengers from North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia

# The number of passengers from North America in the premise is 1/12, and in the hypothesis is 3/12
# The number of passengers from Europe in the premise is 1/8, and in the hypothesis is 1/8
# The number of passengers from Africa in the premise is 1/3, and in the hypothesis is 1/3
# The number of passengers from Asia in the premise is 1/6, and in the hypothesis is 1/6

# We can infer entailment because the number of passengers from each continent in the hypothesis is the same as in the premise, but with a different proportion of passengers from North America
