Premise: less than 4300, Deepak's share is :
Hypothesis: 1300, Deepak's share is :

We are given two statements about Deepak's share in a certain amount. The premise states that Deepak's share is less than 4300, while the hypothesis states that Deepak's share is exactly 1300.

To determine if the hypothesis contradicts or entails the premise, we need to compare the values of Deepak's share mentioned in both statements.

Since the premise states that Deepak's share is less than 4300, and the hypothesis states that Deepak's share is exactly 1300, we can see that the hypothesis contradicts the premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral.
