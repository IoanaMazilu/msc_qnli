# The hypothesis refers to the number of hours Sheila works per day, which is also mentioned in the premise.
# However, the hypothesis does not entail or contradict the premise.
label = "neutral"

# The hypothesis specifies the number of hours Sheila works per day, which is not explicitly mentioned in the premise.
# Therefore, the hypothesis is not a contradiction of the premise.

# The premise does not explicitly state the number of hours Sheila works per day,
# so we cannot infer a contradiction from the premise.

# The premise and the hypothesis both refer to the number of hours Sheila works per day,
# but they do not provide enough information to determine if the hypothesis contradicts the premise.
