# The premise and hypothesis are about the number of different routes Bill could take to walk from one point to another.
# The premise gives the starting and ending points and the need for the shortest route.
# The hypothesis gives the starting and ending points but in a different configuration.

# The hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as the ending points are the same.
# However, the starting points are different, which means there could be more than one route.

# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction based solely on the premise and hypothesis.
