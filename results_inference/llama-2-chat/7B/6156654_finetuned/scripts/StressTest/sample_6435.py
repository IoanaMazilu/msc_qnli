# The hypothesis refers to the same situation as the premise, but with a different tip rate limit.

# The premise mentions the hourly wage and tip rate for Jill as a waitress.
# The hypothesis also mentions the hourly wage and tip rate, but with a different limit.

# Since the premise and hypothesis both refer to the same situation, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction.
# However, we can infer neutral, as the hypothesis does not explicitly contradict the premise.
