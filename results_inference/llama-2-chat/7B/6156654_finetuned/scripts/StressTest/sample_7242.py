# The premise gives an age relationship between Ayisha's father and Shankar's age
# after 10 years, which will be twice Shankar's age.
# The hypothesis states a different age relationship.

# The hypothesis does not entail the premise, since the premise does not provide
# any information about the age relationship after less than 80 years.

# The premise and hypothesis are neutral with respect to each other.
