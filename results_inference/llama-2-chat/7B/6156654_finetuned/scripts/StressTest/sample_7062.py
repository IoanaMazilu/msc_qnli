# The premise and hypothesis both talk about the sides of a triangle
# The premise gives exact values for the sides, while the hypothesis gives a range
# The hypothesis contradicts the premise as the hypothesis values are less than 66

# the hypothesis talks about the sides of the triangle, and the premise gives exact values for the sides
# the hypothesis also talks about the sides of the triangle

# the hypothesis values are less than 66, which contradicts the premise values
# therefore, the relation is contradiction

relation = "contradiction"
