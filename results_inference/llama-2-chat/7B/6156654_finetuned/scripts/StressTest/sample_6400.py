# The premise and hypothesis are similar, but the numbers are different.
# We can't infer entailment or contradiction because of the different numbers.
# However, we can infer neutral because the ratios of the number of passengers at each airport are the same.

# The hypothesis refers to the number of passengers that used Logan Airport, which is also mentioned in the premise.
# The hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it also does not entail it.
# Therefore, the relation is neutral.
