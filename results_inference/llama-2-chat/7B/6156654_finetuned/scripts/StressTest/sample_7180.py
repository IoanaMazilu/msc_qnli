# The premise gives information about the driving time and speed of Andrew from City A to City B.
# The hypothesis also gives information about the driving time and speed of Andrew from City A to City B.
# The premise and hypothesis are both about the driving time and speed of Andrew from City A to City B.

# The hypothesis refers to the driving time and speed of Andrew at 42 mph and 60 mph, which are also mentioned in the premise.
# The premise does not explicitly mention the duration of the driving at 60 mph, but it can be inferred from the total driving time.
# Therefore, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise.
