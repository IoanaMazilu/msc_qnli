# The premise and hypothesis both describe Harry's pay per hour worked
# However, the hypothesis limits the number of hours worked in the premise

# The premise does not explicitly mention the number of hours worked
# However, the hypothesis implies that the number of hours worked in the premise is less than 84

# Since the premise does not explicitly state the number of hours worked, we cannot entail the hypothesis
