# The hypothesis talks about the percentage of top-10 movie lists that a film must appear in to be considered for "movie of the year"
# The premise also talks about the percentage of top-10 movie lists that a film must appear in to be considered for "movie of the year"

# The hypothesis states a percentage less than 4/4, which is less than the percentage in the premise
# The premise states the percentage must be at least 1/4, which is greater than the percentage in the hypothesis

# Since the percentage in the hypothesis is less than the percentage in the premise, we can infer entailment

label = "entailment"
