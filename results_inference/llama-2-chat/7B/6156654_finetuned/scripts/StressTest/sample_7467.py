# the premise states that level-1 college graduates account for 10% of Listco's sales staff
# the hypothesis states that level-less than 7 college graduates account for 10% of Listco's sales staff

# we can infer the hypothesis from the premise
# since the premise does not specify the level of graduation, we can infer the same level of graduation in the hypothesis
# the hypothesis is consistent with the premise, so we cannot infer entailment or contradiction
