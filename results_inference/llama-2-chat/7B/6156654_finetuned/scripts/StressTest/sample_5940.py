Premise: In a friendship gang Mala has 5 gang, in how many ways can he invite one or more of the gang to his house?
Hypothesis: In a friendship gang Mala has more than 2 gang, in how many ways can he invite one or more of the gang to his house?

Since the hypothesis states that Mala has more than 2 gang, it can be inferred that the premise's 5 gang is less than the number of gang in the hypothesis. Therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise.
