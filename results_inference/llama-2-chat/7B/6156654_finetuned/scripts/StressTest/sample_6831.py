# The premise and hypothesis are counting the number of possible ways for a group of girls and boys to go on a date
# The premise specifies the number of girls (Rebecca, Kate, Ashley) and the number of boys (Peter, Kyle, Sam)
# The hypothesis specifies the number of girls (more than 1) and the number of boys (the same as in the premise)

# We are interested in the number of possible ways, which is the same in both the premise and hypothesis
# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction from the given premise and hypothesis
# However, we can infer neutrality, as the hypothesis does not provide any additional information about the number of girls or boys
label = "neutral"
