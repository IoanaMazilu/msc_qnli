# the premise states that Dan can do a job alone in less than 25 hours
# the hypothesis states that Dan can do a job alone in 15 hours

# the premise does not mention the exact time it takes Dan to do the job
# the hypothesis mentions a specific time of 15 hours, which is less than the time in the premise

# we cannot infer entailment or contradiction from the premise and hypothesis
# as the premise does not provide enough information to determine the time it takes Dan to do the job
# the hypothesis also does not provide enough information to determine if it contradicts the premise
