# The hypothesis mentions the marks obtained by Nancy in each subject, which are also mentioned in the premise.
# However, the hypothesis specifies the marks Nancy obtained in each subject as less than a certain number, which is not mentioned in the premise.

# The premise does not provide any information about the marks Nancy obtained in each subject, only their actual marks.
# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction from the premise.
