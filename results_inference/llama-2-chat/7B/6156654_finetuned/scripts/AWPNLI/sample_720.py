# the hypothesis refers to the total number of apples the farmer has now, which can be computed from the premise
# the hypothesis also refers to the number of apples the neighbor gave the farmer, which is already accounted for in the premise
# the hypothesis cannot be entailed from the premise, as it provides additional information about the total number of apples
# the hypothesis and the premise are contradictory, as the total number of apples in the hypothesis (215.0) is greater than the total number of apples in the premise (127.0 + 88.0)
