# the hypothesis refers to the number of Sally's baseball cards now, which can be calculated based on the initial number of cards and the number of cards bought
# the premise gives the initial number of cards and the number of cards bought, but it does not provide any information about the number of new cards
# therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction based on the premise and hypothesis
