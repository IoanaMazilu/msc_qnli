# the hypothesis refers to the total number of pots, which can be calculated from the premise
# the premise gives the total number of flowers and pots, but the hypothesis gives a specific number for the total number of pots

# the hypothesis cannot be entailed from the premise, as it is a specific number that is not given in the premise
# the hypothesis is a contradiction to the premise, as the total number of pots in the premise is not equal to the number given in the hypothesis
