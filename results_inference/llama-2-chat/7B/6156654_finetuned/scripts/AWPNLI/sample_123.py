distance_walked = 4.0
speed = 3.0
time = 2.9

# The hypothesis refers to the time taken to walk a certain distance, which is also mentioned in the premise
# However, the premise does not provide the exact time taken, only the distance and speed
# We can infer that the time taken to walk the distance is less than 2.9 hours based on the premise
# However, this does not contradict the hypothesis as it only provides an upper bound for the time taken
