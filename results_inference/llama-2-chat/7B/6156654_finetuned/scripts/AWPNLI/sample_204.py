# The hypothesis refers to the area of the sandbox, which can be calculated based on the length and width of the sandbox.
# The premise gives the length and width of the sandbox, which can be used to calculate the area.

# The hypothesis states a specific area of the sandbox, which can be compared to the area calculated from the premise.
# If the hypothesis area is greater than the calculated area, it is an entailment.
# If the hypothesis area is less than or equal to the calculated area, it is a contradiction.
