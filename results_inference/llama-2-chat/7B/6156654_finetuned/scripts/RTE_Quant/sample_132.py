# The premise and hypothesis both refer to Carl Lewis's achievements in athletics
# However, the premise provides additional information about Carl Lewis's background and career trajectory
# The hypothesis, on the other hand, focuses solely on Carl Lewis's achievements

# The premise does not directly contradict the hypothesis
# However, the premise provides additional context that could potentially affect the interpretation of the hypothesis
# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction based solely on the premise and hypothesis
