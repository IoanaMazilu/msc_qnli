# The premise and hypothesis are both related to the stock market and trading calls

# The premise mentions the SENSEX and Tata Motors, while the hypothesis mentions Sensex and Nifty
# We can infer from the premise that the SENSEX and Tata Motors are up, but we cannot infer the same for the Nifty
# The hypothesis mentions the Nifty future stock trading call on Wednesday, which is not mentioned in the premise

# Since the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, we can infer entailment

label = "entailment"
