# The hypothesis and premise mention the same stock market data and future trading calls

# The hypothesis mentions SENSEX and Nifty down, which is not explicitly stated in the premise
# However, the premise does mention a 357.39 points drop in Sensex, which is not mentioned in the hypothesis
# Also, the hypothesis mentions intraday stock future trading call tomorrow, which is not mentioned in the premise

# Since the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and does not provide any additional information, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction
