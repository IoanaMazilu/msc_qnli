# There are no numerical entities in the premise or hypothesis, so we cannot calculate a numerical probability for entailment or contradiction.

# The hypothesis states a specific number of seasons for which Reinsdorf was the chairman of the White Sox, which is also mentioned in the premise.
# Since the hypothesis does not provide any additional information, we can infer entailment with a neutral label.
