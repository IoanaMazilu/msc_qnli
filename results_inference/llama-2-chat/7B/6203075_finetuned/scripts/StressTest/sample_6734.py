# The premise and hypothesis are about the number of different routes Bill could take to walk from two different locations.
# We can represent the locations in a dictionary with keys being the road numbers and values being the avenue numbers.

# The hypothesis refers to the same locations as the premise but with different road numbers.
# We can infer entailment since the hypothesis is a specific case of the premise.
