# The hypothesis talks about the same situation as the premise
# but the condition for T is different

# The hypothesis condition for T is more than 2/9 * (K-32)
# The premise condition for T is 5/9 * (K-32)

# We can't compare these two conditions directly
# However, we can infer that the value of T in the hypothesis is greater than the one in the premise
