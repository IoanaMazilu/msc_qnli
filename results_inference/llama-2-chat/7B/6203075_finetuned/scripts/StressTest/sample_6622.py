# The hypothesis talks about the number of possible committees of 4 people, which is also referenced in the premise.
# However, the hypothesis refers to a specific situation where at least one of Jane or Thomas is to be selected, which cannot be entailed from the premise.
# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction, but rather consider the hypothesis as neutral.
