# The hypothesis talks about the on-time departure rate of flights from Phoenix, which is also mentioned in the premise.
# However, the hypothesis specifies a higher on-time departure rate (60%) than the premise (more than 20%).
# Since the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, we infer entailment.
