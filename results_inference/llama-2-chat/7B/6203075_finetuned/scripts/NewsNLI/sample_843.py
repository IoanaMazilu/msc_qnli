# The premise and hypothesis both refer to Mark Webber's position in the Formula One world championship race

# The premise mentions Mark Webber's second place behind Sebastian Vettel in the Japanese Grand Prix
# The hypothesis also mentions Mark Webber's lead in the world title race

# We can infer from the premise that Mark Webber extended his lead in the world title race
# However, the hypothesis does not explicitly state that Mark Webber extended his lead
# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction from the premise and hypothesis.
