# The premise and hypothesis do not provide numerical information about the same entity, so we cannot establish entailment or contradiction based on numerical values.
label = "neutral"

# However, we can compare the geographic locations mentioned in the premise and hypothesis.
# Since the premise mentions Perry County, and the hypothesis does not provide any geographic information, we can infer that the hypothesis refers to a different location.
# Therefore, we cannot establish entailment or contradiction based on geographic locations either.
