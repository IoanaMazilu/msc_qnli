# There are no numerical entities in either the premise or the hypothesis, so we cannot perform a numerical entailment check.
# However, we can check for entailment based on the text.

# The hypothesis mentions the death of Robert Enke, which is also mentioned in the premise.
# However, the premise does not specify the cause of death, which is mentioned in the hypothesis.
# Since the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, we can infer entailment.
