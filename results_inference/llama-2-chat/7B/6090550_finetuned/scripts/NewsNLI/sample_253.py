# The premise and hypothesis both talk about the relationship between an abuser having a gun and the chance of a woman dying in a domestic abuse situation.

# The hypothesis states that women are 5 times more likely to die if the abuser has a gun, which is not explicitly stated in the premise.
# However, the premise does state that the chance of a woman dying increases by 500% if the abuser has access to a gun.
# Therefore, we cannot directly infer entailment or contradiction from the premise and hypothesis.
