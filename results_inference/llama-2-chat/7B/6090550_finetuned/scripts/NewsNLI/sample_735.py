# There are no numerical entities in this premise or hypothesis, so no variables to define.
# However, the hypothesis refers to the same person mentioned in the premise, so we can compare the two.
# The premise mentions the person as the assistant manager at Chelsea, but does not specify if they were also at Barcelona.
# The hypothesis, however, specifies that they were also the assistant coach at Barcelona.
# Since the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, we infer entailment.
