# There are no numerical entities in the premise or hypothesis, so we cannot perform a numerical comparison.

# However, we can compare the text of the premise and hypothesis to determine if they entail, contradict or are neutral with respect to each other.

# The hypothesis mentions that Robert Enke died in an apparent suicide, which is also mentioned in the premise.
# Since both statements describe the same event, we can infer entailment.
