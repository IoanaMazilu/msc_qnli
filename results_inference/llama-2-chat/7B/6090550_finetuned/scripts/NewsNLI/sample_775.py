# The premise and hypothesis talk about the authorization of funding for a USDA investigation.
# Both mention the amount of funding authorized, which is $1 million.

# The premise does not provide any additional details about the investigation, such as the location or the purpose.
# The hypothesis does not mention the specific location of the slaughterhouse.

# Since the premise and hypothesis both mention the same amount of funding authorized, but do not provide any other details that contradict each other, we can infer entailment.
