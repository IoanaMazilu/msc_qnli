# There are no numerical entities in the premise or hypothesis, so we cannot perform a direct comparison.

# However, we can compare the general information conveyed by both sentences.

# The premise and hypothesis both refer to fatalities related to recliners.
# The premise mentions that there have been four more fatalities, while the hypothesis mentions five infant deaths.
# Since the premise and hypothesis are referring to the same general topic (fatalities related to recliners), we can infer entailment.
