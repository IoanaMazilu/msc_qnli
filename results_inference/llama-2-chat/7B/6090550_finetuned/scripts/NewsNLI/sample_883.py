# There are no numerical entities in the premise or hypothesis, so we cannot perform a numerical comparison
# However, we can check if the premise and hypothesis are consistent with each other

# The hypothesis refers to Barack Obama and John McCain, who are also mentioned in the premise
# However, the premise does not specify the exact actions of these individuals
# Therefore, the hypothesis is consistent with the premise, but we cannot infer entailment
