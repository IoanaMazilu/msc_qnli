# There are no numerical entities in the premise or the hypothesis, so no numerical comparison is needed.

# The hypothesis mentions Jillian Meredith McCabe's age, which is also mentioned in the premise
# However, the age in the hypothesis is not the same as in the premise, so we cannot infer entailment or contradiction based on this fact.

# The hypothesis also mentions the bail amount, which is not mentioned in the premise, so we cannot infer entailment or contradiction based on this fact either.
