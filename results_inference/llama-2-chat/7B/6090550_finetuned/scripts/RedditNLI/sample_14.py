# The premise and hypothesis are discussing the same topic of oil demand and supply.
# However, the hypothesis adds a new detail about the amount of oil needed to be found.

# The premise mentions the amount of oil needed to be found as 1.5 million barrels per day.
# The hypothesis mentions the same amount, but adds the detail about the shortfall in the second half.

# Since the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, we can infer entailment.
