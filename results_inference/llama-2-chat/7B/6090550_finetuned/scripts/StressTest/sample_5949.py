# The premise and hypothesis are both dealing with the same equation involving T and K.
# The hypothesis refers to a different condition for T.

# The premise equation is T = 5/9 * (K-32)
# The hypothesis equation is T = more than 2/9 * (K-32)

# The hypothesis equation does not contradict the premise equation, but it does not entail it either.
# The condition in the hypothesis for T is more restrictive than the condition in the premise.
