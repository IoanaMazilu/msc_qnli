# There are no numerical entities in the premise or the hypothesis
# Therefore, no comparison is needed

# The hypothesis states that Andy has less than 60 pairs of gloves
# The premise states that Andy has 20 pairs of gloves
# However, the premise does not specify the number of pairs of gloves Andy has
# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction based on this information
# The relation is neutral
