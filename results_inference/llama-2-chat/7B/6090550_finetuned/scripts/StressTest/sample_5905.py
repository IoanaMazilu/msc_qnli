# the hypothesis talks about the amount of cookies eaten by Michael, Steve and Tyler
# the premise also talks about the amount of cookies eaten by Michael, Steve and Tyler

# the hypothesis states that Michael ate 1/8 of the cookies, Steve ate 1/2 and Tyler ate 150 more cookies than Michael
# the premise states that Michael ate less than 7/8 of the cookies, Steve ate one half and Tyler ate 150 more cookies than Michael

# the hypothesis contradicts the premise because it states that Michael ate more than 7/8 of the cookies, which contradicts the premise
