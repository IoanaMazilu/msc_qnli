 ratio of toy bricks in the premise: 1:3:1
ratio of toy bricks in the hypothesis: 4:3:1

First, we calculate the ratio of red to green to blue bricks in the premise:
ratio_premise = 1/3

Then, we calculate the ratio of red to green to blue bricks in the hypothesis:
ratio_hypothesis = 4/3

Now, we compare the ratios in the premise and hypothesis:
if ratio_premise == ratio_hypothesis:
    # the hypothesis states the same ratio as the premise
    label = "entailment"
elif ratio_premise!= ratio_hypothesis:
    # the hypothesis ratio contradicts the premise ratio
    label = "contradiction"
else:
    # if the ratios are the same, it is neutral
    label = "neutral"

print(label)
