y - employees in the premise
y - employees in the hypothesis

employees in the premise = employees in the hypothesis

#1: the hypothesis talks about the number of employees at Veridux Corporation, which is also mentioned in the premise

if employees in the hypothesis!= employees in the premise:
    #2: check if the number of employees in the hypothesis contradicts the number of employees reported in the premise
    label = "contradiction"
else:
    #3: if the number of employees in the hypothesis does not contradict the number of employees reported in the premise, we can infer entailment
    label = "entailment"
