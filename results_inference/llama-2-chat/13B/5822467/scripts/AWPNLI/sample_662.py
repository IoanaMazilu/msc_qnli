# Extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats)

# Use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables
# (do not use their values in the comments)

# Refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation

# Use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following:
# entailment, contradiction, or neutrality

# Use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know "A is more than B", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction)

# Sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed

# Define the hypothesis variables
total_cats_hypothesis = 28.0

# Compare the variables
if total_cats_hypothesis > total_cats_premise:
    # Check if the total number of cats in the hypothesis contradicts the estimate in the premise
    label = "contradiction"
elif total_cats_hypothesis == total_cats_premise:
    # Check if the total number of cats in the hypothesis is equal to the estimate in the premise
    label = "entailment"
else:
    # If the total number of cats in the hypothesis is less than the estimate in the premise, no comparison is needed
    label = "neutrality"
