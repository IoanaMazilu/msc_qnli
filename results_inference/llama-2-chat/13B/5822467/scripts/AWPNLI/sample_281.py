# Now, let's answer the given input:

# Define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs
carrots_picked_premise = 48.0
carrots_thrown_premise = 11.0
carrots_picked_next_day_premise = 15.0
total_carrots_hypothesis = 50.0

# END_EXAMPLE

# Now, let's compare the total number of carrots in the premise and the hypothesis:

# Total number of carrots in the premise:
carrots_picked_premise + carrots_thrown_premise + carrots_picked_next_day_premise = 48.0 + 11.0 + 15.0 = 74.0

# Total number of carrots in the hypothesis:
total_carrots_hypothesis = 50.0

# Check if the total number of carrots in the hypothesis contradicts the premise:
if total_carrots_hypothesis!= 74.0:
    # Infer "contradiction"
    print("contradiction")
else:
    # Infer "neutrality"
    print("neutrality")
