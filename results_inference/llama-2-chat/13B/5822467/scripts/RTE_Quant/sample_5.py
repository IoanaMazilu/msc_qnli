# Comments explaining the comparison
# The hypothesis mentions the distance of Scott Island from Victoria, which is also mentioned in the premise
# However, the premise does not provide the exact distance of Scott Island from Victoria
# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction based on the numerical values alone

# Perform calculations if necessary
# Since the distance of Scott Island from Victoria is not explicitly mentioned in the premise, we cannot perform any calculations

# Compare the variables
# Since the numerical values are not contradictory, we cannot conclude entailment or contradiction
# Therefore, the label is neutral
