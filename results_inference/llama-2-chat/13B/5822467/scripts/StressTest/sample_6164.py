# Define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs
wheat_premise = 30

# Extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats)
# Do not ignore any quantity or numerical information

# Use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables
# Any comparison you do should be done through code as well

# Refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation

# Use the variables to perform calculations if necessary

# Compare the variables to infer one of the following:
#   - "entailment": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
#   - "contradiction": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
#   - "neutral": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise

# Use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know "A is more than B", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction)

# Sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed

# Print the label (entailment, contradiction, or neutral) based on the comparison

# Example:
# If the hypothesis is "Arun purchased more than 30 kg of wheat at the rate of Rs. 100",
# we can infer entailment because the hypothesis value is greater than the premise value.

# If the hypothesis is "Arun purchased 30 kg of wheat at the rate of Rs. 50",
# we can infer neutral because the hypothesis value is equal to the premise value.

# If the hypothesis is "Arun purchased 50 kg of wheat at the rate of Rs. 100",
# we can infer contradiction because the hypothesis value is greater than the premise value.

# Print the label based on the comparison
