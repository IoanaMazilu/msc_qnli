# Define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs
tom_goes_premise = 8
tom_goes_hypothesis = 6

# Extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats)
# Do not ignore any quantity or numerical information

# Use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables
# Do not use their values in the comments

# Refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation

# Use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following:
# entailment: the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
# contradiction: at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
# neutral: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise

# Use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know "A is more than B", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction)

# Sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed

# Answer with the appropriate label (entailment, contradiction, or neutral)

# Start by comparing the two values for tom's goes
if tom_goes_hypothesis <= tom_goes_premise:
    # Check if the estimate of 'tom_goes_hypothesis' contradicts the number of goes reported in the premise
    label = "contradiction"
elif tom_goes_premise!= tom_goes_hypothesis:
    # Check if the number of goes in the hypothesis contradicts the number of goes reported in the premise
    label = "contradiction"
else:
    # If the hypothesis values and estimates do not contradict the premise ones, we can infer entailment
    label = "entailment"

print(label)
