# Define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs
annie_working_hours_premise = 10
annie_working_hours_hypothesis = 40

# Extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats)
# Do not ignore any quantity or numerical information

# Use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables
# Any comparison you do should be done through code as well

# Refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation

# Use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following:
# entailment, contradiction, or neutral

# Use the correct comparison operators (e.g., if we know "A is more than B", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction)

# Sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed

# Example 1:
# Premise: He sold $200-worth of cookies at the school fair and 15 pies.
# Hypothesis: He sold cookies worth more than $100 and 15 pies.
# Answer:

if annie_working_hours_premise <= annie_working_hours_hypothesis:
    # Check if the estimate of 'annie_working_hours_hypothesis' contradicts the number of working hours in the premise
    label = "contradiction"
elif annie_working_hours_hypothesis!= annie_working_hours_premise:
    # Check if the number of working hours in the hypothesis contradicts the number of working hours reported in the premise
    label = "contradiction"
else:
    # If the hypothesis values and estimates do not contradict the premise ones, we can infer entailment
    label = "entailment"

print(label)

# Example 2:
# Premise: There are more than 10 roses in the vase.
# Hypothesis: There are 15 roses in the vase.
# Answer:

if annie_working_hours_hypothesis <= annie_working_hours_premise:
    # Check if the hypothesis value contradicts the estimate of more than 'annie_working_hours_premise'
    label = "contradiction"
else:
    # The premise gives only an estimate for the number of roses
    # Any number of roses greater than 'annie_working_hours_premise' is consistent with the premise, but cannot be explicitly entailed from the premise
    label = "neutral"

print(label)
