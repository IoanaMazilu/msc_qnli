# Define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs

# Extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats)
# Do not ignore any quantity or numerical information

# Use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables
# Any comparison you do should be done through code as well

# Refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation

# Use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following:
# entailment, contradiction, or neutral

# Use the correct comparison operators (e.g., if we know "A is more than B", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction)

# Sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed

# Answer with the script

# Infer the label based on the comparison of the defined variables

    # The hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the number of participants in the race is smaller in the hypothesis than in the premise

elif meg_bob_premise == meg_bob_hypothesis:
    # The hypothesis is neutral with respect to the premise, as the number of participants in the race is the same in both
