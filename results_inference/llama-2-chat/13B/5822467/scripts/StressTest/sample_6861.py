# extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats)
# do not ignore any quantity or numerical information

# use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables
# do not use their values in the comments

# refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation

# use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following:
#   - "entailment": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
#   - "contradiction": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
#   - "neutral": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise

# use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know "A is more than B", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction)

# sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed

# answer with the label (entailment, contradiction, or neutral)

# check if the hypothesis value contradicts the estimate of Matthew's walk in the premise
