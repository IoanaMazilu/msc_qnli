# define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs

# extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats)
# do not ignore any quantity or numerical information

# use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables
# do not use their values in the comments

# refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation
# use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following:
#   - "entailment": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
#   - "contradiction": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
#   - "neutral": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise

# use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know "A is more than B", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction)

# sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed

# perform the comparison and print the label
label = ""

# check if the number of women in the hypothesis is the same as the number of women in the premise
if women_hypothesis == women_premise:
    # if the number of women is the same in both the premise and hypothesis, we can infer neutrality
    label = "neutral"
elif women_hypothesis > women_premise:
    # if the number of women in the hypothesis is greater than the number of women in the premise, we can infer entailment
    label = "entailment"
else:
    # if the number of women in the hypothesis is less than the number of women in the premise, we can infer contradiction
    label = "contradiction"
