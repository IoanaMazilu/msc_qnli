# The hypothesis and premise both mention the amount of money stolen by Wheeler
# The hypothesis states Wheeler is accused of stealing more than $45,000 in grants, financial aid
# The premise states Wheeler is accused of stealing over $45,000 in grants, scholarship and financial aid money

# The hypothesis and premise both mention the same amount of money stolen
# However, the premise also mentions that the money was awarded to Wheeler on applications and submissions of documents that were based on lies and reproductions of other people's hard work
# The hypothesis does not mention these details

# Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not contradictory, but the premise provides more information than the hypothesis
