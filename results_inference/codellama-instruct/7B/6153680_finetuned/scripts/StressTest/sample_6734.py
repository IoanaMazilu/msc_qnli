# The premise and hypothesis are the same, but with different starting and ending points
# The premise states that Bill needs to walk from the corner of 2nd Rd and 3rd Ave to the corner of 10th Rd and 5th Ave
# The hypothesis states that Bill needs to walk from the corner of 5th Rd and 3rd Ave to the corner of 10th Rd and 5th Ave

# The premise and hypothesis are the same, so the relation is entailment
relation = "entailment"
