# the hypothesis refers to the number of flights that need to depart on-time for the airport's on-time departure rate to be higher than 10%
# the premise also refers to the number of flights that need to depart on-time for the airport's on-time departure rate to be higher than 50%

# the hypothesis and premise are asking for the same information, but with different percentages
# the hypothesis states that the airport's on-time departure rate needs to be higher than 10%, while the premise states that it needs to be higher than 50%

# since the hypothesis and premise are asking for different percentages, the hypothesis cannot be entailed from the premise
