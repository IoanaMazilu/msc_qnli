# The hypothesis refers to the driving speeds of Karen and Tom mentioned in the premise
# The hypothesis also mentions the distance (Q miles) before Karen wins the bet

# The premise gives the average driving speed of Karen and Tom
karen_speed = 60
tom_speed = 45

# The hypothesis gives the average driving speed of Karen and Tom
hypothesis_karen_speed = 80

# The hypothesis also gives the distance (Q miles) before Karen wins the bet
q_miles = 0

# The hypothesis states that Karen drives at an average speed less than 'hypothesis_karen_speed'
if karen_speed >= hypothesis_karen_speed:
    # If Karen's speed is less than or equal to the hypothesis speed, then Karen will win the bet
    # Calculate the distance (Q miles) before Karen wins the bet
    q_miles = (hypothesis_karen_speed - karen_speed) * tom_speed

# The hypothesis and premise both give the driving speed of Tom
# The hypothesis and premise also give the distance (Q miles) before Karen wins the bet
# The hypothesis and premise are consistent with each other

# The hypothesis and premise are both referring to the same situation
# Therefore, the relationship between the hypothesis and premise is entailment
