# The hypothesis refers to the number of top-10 movies lists submitted by the Cinematic Academy's members
# The premise also refers to the number of top-10 movies lists submitted by the Cinematic Academy's members

# The hypothesis and premise are both referring to the same topic
# The hypothesis is a more specific statement than the premise
# The hypothesis states that a film must appear in less than 4/4 of the top-10 movies lists submitted by the Cinematic Academy's members
# The premise states that a film must appear in at least 1/4 of the top-10 movies lists submitted by the Cinematic Academy's members
