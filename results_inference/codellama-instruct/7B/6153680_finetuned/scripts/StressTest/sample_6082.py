# The hypothesis refers to the same situation as the premise, but with different numbers
# The hypothesis states that Rahul is 12 th from the right and 4 th from the left, and that there are 28 boys in the line
# The premise states that Rahul is less than 62 th from the right and 4 th from the left, and that there are 28 boys in the line

# The hypothesis and premise are both referring to the same situation, but with different numbers
# Therefore, the relation between the hypothesis and the premise is entailment
