# The premise and hypothesis both ask about the distance between Karen and Tom.
# The premise gives the average speed of Karen and Tom, while the hypothesis gives the average speed of Karen and Tom.

# The hypothesis states that Karen drives at an average speed of 60 mph and Tom drives at an average speed of 45 mph.
# The premise states that Karen drives at an average speed of more than 20 mph and Tom drives at an average speed of 45 mph.

# The hypothesis and premise both give the average speed of Karen and Tom.
# The hypothesis gives a specific average speed for Karen, which is more than the average speed given in the premise.
# The premise gives a range of average speeds for Karen, which is less than the average speed given in the hypothesis.

# Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are in conflict, and the relation between Karen and Tom cannot be determined.
