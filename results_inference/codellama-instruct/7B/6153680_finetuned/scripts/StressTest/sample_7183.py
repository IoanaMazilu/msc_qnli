# The hypothesis refers to the same situation as the premise, but with a different proportion of passengers from different continents
# The premise and hypothesis both state that the number of passengers on a ship is 35 + 1/12 + 1/8 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 35 + 1/7
# The hypothesis also states that the number of passengers on a ship is 35 + 1/12 + 1/8 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 35 + 1/7
# Therefore, the hypothesis is consistent with the premise, and we can infer entailment
