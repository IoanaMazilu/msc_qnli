# Define variables for the marks obtained by the student in each subject
geography_marks = 26
history_marks = 60
government_marks = 72
art_marks = 85
computer_science_marks = 80
modern_literature_marks = 80

# Calculate the total marks obtained by the student
total_marks = geography_marks + history_marks + government_marks + art_marks + computer_science_marks + modern_literature_marks

# Calculate the average marks obtained by the student
average_marks = total_marks / 6

# Print the average marks obtained by the student
print(average_marks)
