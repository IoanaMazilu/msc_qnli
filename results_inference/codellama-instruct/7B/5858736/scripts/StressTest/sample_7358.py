# Extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats)
# Do not ignore any quantity or numerical information

# Use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables
# Do not use their values in the comments

# Refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation

# Use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following:
# "entailment": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
# "contradiction": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
# "neutral": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either

# Use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know "A is more than B", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction)

# Sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed

# In this case, the hypothesis is not consistent with the premise, so we can infer a contradiction
label = "contradiction"
