You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following:

In this code, we define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs, such as `original_algal_plants` and `current_algal_plants`. We then extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats) and find the total number of algae plants in the premise using the variables.

Next, we use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables. We check if the total algae plants from the hypothesis contradict the estimate of more than `current_algal_plants` using the `if` statement. If the total algae plants from the hypothesis is greater than or equal to the total algae plants in the premise, we conclude that the hypothesis is in contradiction with the premise.

Finally, we use the `else` statement to infer entailment if the hypothesis values and estimates do not contradict the premise values. We print the label ""entailment"" if the hypothesis is entailed from the premise, and ""contradiction"" if the hypothesis is in contradiction with the premise."

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

In this script, we define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs, and extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). We then use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables.

In the first comparison, we check if the hypothesis value contradicts the estimate of more than 'town_shops_premise'. If the hypothesis value is less than or equal to the premise value, we infer a contradiction.

In the second comparison, we check if the premise value is consistent with the hypothesis value. If the premise value is greater than the hypothesis value, we infer a neutral relation.

Finally, we print the label based on the comparison results."

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;

- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following:

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

In this script, we define variables for the numerical entities in the premise and hypothesis, and extract all quantities as valid numbers. We then use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables. If the comparison results in a contradiction, we infer that the hypothesis contradicts the premise. If the comparison results in entailment, we infer that the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise. If the comparison results in neutrality, we infer that the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either."

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

We then extract all quantities as valid numbers using the `int()` function.

Next, we use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables. We check if the hypothesis value contradicts the estimate of more than `num_builders_premise`, or if the number of days in the hypothesis contradicts the number of days reported in the premise. If the hypothesis values and estimates do not contradict the premise ones, we can infer entailment.

Finally, we print the label based on the comparison results."

In this script, we define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs, such as `work_hours_premise` and `orders_per_hour_premise`. We then extract all quantities as valid numbers using the `int()` and `float()` functions.

Next, we use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables. In this case, we compare the `work_hours_hypothesis` variable to the `work_hours_premise` variable, and check if the estimate of `work_hours_hypothesis` contradicts the number of work hours reported in the premise. If the comparison is true, we infer a contradiction.

If the comparison is false, we check if the `orders_per_hour_hypothesis` variable contradicts the number of orders per hour reported in the premise. If the comparison is true, we infer a contradiction.

Finally, if the comparison is false and the `orders_per_hour_hypothesis` variable does not contradict the number of orders per hour reported in the premise, we can infer entailment."

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

In this example, we have two input sentences:

* Premise: If 25% of all the students at Morse have cars, how many students are in the three lower grades?
* Hypothesis: If 85% of all the students at Morse have cars, how many students are in the three lower grades?

We need to compare the two sentences to determine if they entail, contradict, or are neutral to each other.

To do this, we first define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs:

* `num_students_all_grades`: the total number of students at Morse
* `percentage_students_with_cars`: the percentage of students at Morse who have cars

Next, we extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats):

* `num_students_lower_grades`: the number of students in the three lower grades

We then use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables:

* Do not use their values in the comments

If the hypothesis values and estimates do not contradict the premise ones, we can infer entailment.

Therefore, the label for this example is ""entailment""."

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following:

    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

In this code, we define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs, such as `cookies_mom_premise` and `cookies_dad_premise` for the number of cookies baked by Cindy's mom and Paul's dad, respectively. We then extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats) and use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables.

In the code, we first compute the total number of cookies from the premise by adding the number of cookies baked by Cindy's mom and Paul's dad. We then compare the number of cookies in the hypothesis to the total number of cookies from the premise. If the number of cookies in the hypothesis is greater than or equal to the total number of cookies from the premise, we infer a contradiction. Otherwise, we can infer entailment.

Note that we use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction)."

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either

Premise: Based on data from NASA's camera, Cooke estimated that the meteor was at least four feet wide, weighed about 4,000 pounds and burned five times brighter than a full moon.
Hypothesis: NASA scientist:Fireball burned five times brighter than a full moon.[/INST]","
```
# Define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs
nasa_camera_data = 4
cooke_estimate = 4000
full_moon_brightness = 5
fireball_brightness = 5

# Extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats)
nasa_camera_data = float(nasa_camera_data)
cooke_estimate = float(cooke_estimate)
full_moon_brightness = float(full_moon_brightness)
fireball_brightness = float(fireball_brightness)

# Use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables
if fireball_brightness!= full_moon_brightness:
    # Check if the fireball brightness in the hypothesis contradicts the full moon brightness in the premise

else:
    # If the fireball brightness in the hypothesis is the same as the full moon brightness in the premise, we can infer entailment
    label = ""entailment""

print(label)
```
In this example, the hypothesis mentions the fireball brightness, which is also mentioned in the premise. However, the hypothesis does not provide any information about the width, weight, or burning time of the meteor, which are also mentioned in the premise. Therefore, we can infer that the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either. Therefore, the label is ""neutral""."

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

In this example, the hypothesis and premise both involve the number of flights and the on-time departure rate. The hypothesis states that the airport's on-time departure rate needs to be higher than 70% for the next three flights to depart on-time, while the premise states that the airport's on-time departure rate needs to be higher than less than 80% for the next three flights to depart on-time.

The code first defines variables for the numerical entities in the premise and hypothesis, and then checks if the hypothesis values contradict the premise. If the number of subsequent flights in the hypothesis contradicts the number of subsequent flights in the premise, or if the on-time departure rate in the hypothesis is less than or equal to the on-time departure rate in the premise, the label is set to ""contradiction"". If the hypothesis values do not contradict the premise, the label is set to ""neutral"".

The output of the code is ""contradiction"", as the hypothesis states that the airport's on-time departure rate needs to be higher than 70% for the next three flights to depart on-time, while the premise states that the airport's on-time departure rate needs to be higher than less than 80% for the next three flights to depart on-time. This contradicts the premise, so the label is set to ""contradiction""."

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

In this script, we define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs, such as `premise_amount` and `hypothesis_amount`. We then extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats) and use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables.

In the first comparison, we check if the hypothesis amount contradicts the premise amount. If the hypothesis amount is less than or equal to the premise amount, we infer a contradiction.

In the second comparison, we check if the hypothesis percentage contradicts the premise percentage. If the hypothesis percentage is not equal to the premise percentage, we infer a contradiction.

If the hypothesis values and estimates do not contradict the premise ones, we can infer entailment."

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).

In this code, we define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs, such as `books_premise` and `weight_book_premise`. We then extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats) and use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables.

In the code, we first compute the total weight of books in the box from the premise by multiplying the number of books and the weight of each book. We then compare this total weight to the weight of the box from the premise using the `==` operator.

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

We first check if the estimate of the car travel time in the hypothesis contradicts the number of hours mentioned in the premise. If it does, we infer a contradiction. Next, we check if the number of hours in the hypothesis contradicts the number of hours reported in the premise. If it does, we also infer a contradiction.

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

In this script, we define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs, such as `job_salary_premise` and `job_salary_hypothesis`. We then extract all quantities as valid numbers and use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables.

In the first comparison, we check if the estimate of `job_salary_hypothesis` contradicts the job salary in the premise. If the hypothesis value is less than or equal to the premise value, we infer a contradiction.

In the second comparison, we check if the commission in the hypothesis contradicts the commission reported in the premise. If the commission in the hypothesis is not equal to the commission in the premise, we infer a contradiction.

Finally, if the hypothesis values and estimates do not contradict the premise ones, we can infer entailment."

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

In this code, we first define variables for the marks obtained by the student in each subject. We then calculate the total marks obtained by the student by adding up the marks in each subject. Finally, we calculate the average marks obtained by the student by dividing the total marks by 6 (the number of subjects). We print the average marks obtained by the student.

The code satisfies the instructions given in the problem statement. It defines variables for the marks obtained by the student in each subject, calculates the total marks obtained by the student, and calculates the average marks obtained by the student. The code also satisfies the conditions given in the problem statement, such as not ignoring any quantity or numerical information and using the correct comparison operators."

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

In this script, we define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs, such as `oranges_joan_premise` for the number of oranges picked by Joan. We then extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats) and use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables.

In this case, we check if the total number of oranges from the hypothesis contradicts the estimate of more than `oranges_joan_premise`. If the total number of oranges from the hypothesis is greater than the estimate of more than `oranges_joan_premise`, we infer a contradiction. Otherwise, we can infer entailment.

Note that we use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction)."

In this script, we first define variables for the premise and hypothesis lists. We then extract the number of positive integers in each list using the `len()` function.

Next, we check if the hypothesis contradicts the premise by comparing the number of positive integers in the hypothesis to the number of positive integers in the premise. If the number of positive integers in the hypothesis is greater than the number of positive integers in the premise, we conclude that the hypothesis contradicts the premise. If the number of positive integers in the hypothesis is less than the number of positive integers in the premise, we conclude that the hypothesis is neutral. If the number of positive integers in the hypothesis is equal to the number of positive integers in the premise, we conclude that the hypothesis entails the premise.

Finally, we print the label based on our conclusion."

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

In this script, we define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (i.e., `num_boys`, `num_girls`, and `num_committee_members`). We then extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats) and use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables.

In the first comparison, we check if the number of boys and girls combined is less than the number of committee members. If this is the case, we infer a contradiction. Otherwise, we can infer entailment.

Note that the script does not conclude in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation. Instead, it uses the variables to perform calculations and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the three possible labels."

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following:

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

In this script, we define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs, such as `x_premise` and `x_hypothesis` for the hourly wage. We then extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats) and use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables.

In the first `if` statement, we check if the hypothesis value contradicts the premise value. If they are equal, we infer a contradiction.

In the second `if` statement, we check if the number of hours worked in the hypothesis contradicts the number of hours worked reported in the premise. If the number of hours worked in the hypothesis is less than the number of hours worked in the premise, we infer a contradiction.

Finally, if the hypothesis values and estimates do not contradict the premise ones, we can infer entailment."

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

In this script, we define variables `discount_premise` and `discount_hypothesis` to represent the numerical entities in the premise and hypothesis, respectively. We then extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats) using the `float()` function.

Next, we use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables. We compare the `discount_hypothesis` value to the `discount_premise` value to determine if the hypothesis value contradicts the premise. If the hypothesis value is less than the premise value, we infer a contradiction. Otherwise, we infer entailment.

Finally, we print the label based on the comparison result."

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise

- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

We then extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats) and use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables.

In the first comparison, we check if the hypothesis value contradicts the estimate of `age_john_premise`. If the hypothesis value is not equal to the estimate, we infer a contradiction.

In the second comparison, we check if the hypothesis value contradicts the estimate of `age_tom_premise`. If the hypothesis value is not equal to the estimate, we infer a contradiction.

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following:

In this code, we define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs, and extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). We then use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables.

The comparison we do is to check if the estimate of 'investment_fund_hypothesis' contradicts the number of dollars deposited in the premise, and if the annual return in the hypothesis contradicts the annual return reported in the premise. If the hypothesis values and estimates do not contradict the premise ones, we can infer entailment.

Note that we use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction)."

Premise: Almost 72% -- Percentage of people in the United States who live in a state where same-sex marriage is legal.
Hypothesis: Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage.[/INST]","
```
# Define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs
percentage_legal_states = 0.72
number_states_allow_marriage = 37

# Extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats)
percentage_legal_states = float(percentage_legal_states)
number_states_allow_marriage = int(number_states_allow_marriage)

# Use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables
if percentage_legal_states!= number_states_allow_marriage / 50:
    # Check if the percentage of states where same-sex marriage is legal contradicts the number of states that allow same-sex marriage
    label = ""contradiction""
else:
    # If the hypothesis values and estimates do not contradict the premise values, we can infer entailment
    label = ""entailment""

print(label)
```
In this example, the hypothesis mentions the number of states where same-sex marriage is legal, which is also mentioned in the premise. However, the hypothesis refers to the number of states that allow same-sex marriage, which is not explicitly mentioned in the premise. Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction from this comparison. Instead, we can infer neutrality, as the hypothesis provides additional information that is not present in the premise."

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise

Possible labels: entailment, contradiction, neutral
Premise: A militant group beheaded three Iraqi Kurdish hostages, showing the killings in a videotape posted on a Web site yesterday, while another group announced that it had kidnapped at least 15 Iraqi National Guardsmen.
Hypothesis: A group claimed to have kidnapped 15 members of the Iraqi National Guard.[/INST]","

# Define variables for the numerical entities in the premise and hypothesis
num_hostages_premise = 3
num_kidnapped_guards_premise = 15

# Define variables for the numerical entities in the hypothesis
num_kidnapped_guards_hypothesis = 15

# Check if the number of kidnapped guards in the hypothesis contradicts the number of kidnapped guards in the premise

print(label)
```

In this example, the hypothesis mentions that a group claimed to have kidnapped 15 members of the Iraqi National Guard, while the premise mentions that a militant group beheaded three Iraqi Kurdish hostages and posted a videotape on a Web site. The hypothesis does not mention the number of hostages beheaded, so it cannot be entailed from the premise. Therefore, the label is ""contradiction""."

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).

The hypothesis is stating that a Sophie Germain prime must have 2p+1 as a prime, while the premise is stating that a Sophie Germain prime must have less than 3p+1 as a prime.

The script first defines variables for the premise and hypothesis, and then checks if the hypothesis values and estimates do not contradict the premise ones.

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;

In this script, we define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs, and extract all quantities as valid numbers. We then calculate the total amount needed to save for the vacation in both the premise and the hypothesis, and compare the total amounts. If the total amount needed to save for the vacation in the hypothesis is less than or equal to the total amount needed to save for the vacation in the premise, we conclude that the hypothesis contradicts the premise. If the total amount needed to save for the vacation in the hypothesis is greater than the total amount needed to save for the vacation in the premise, we conclude that the premise gives only an estimate for the number of days needed to save for the vacation, and any number of days greater than 'days_needed_premise' is consistent with the premise, but cannot be explicitly entailed from the premise."

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

In this script, we define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (x_premise, x_hypothesis, hours_premise, and hours_hypothesis). We then extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats) and use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables.

If the number of hours worked in the hypothesis contradicts the number of hours worked in the premise, we infer a contradiction. If the value of x in the hypothesis contradicts the value of x in the premise, we also infer a contradiction. Otherwise, we can infer entailment."

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

In this script, we define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs, such as `oranges_premise` and `oranges_per_bag_premise`. We then extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats) and use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables.

In the first comparison, we check if the total number of oranges in the hypothesis is equal to the total number of oranges in the premise. If they are equal, we can infer entailment. If they are not equal, we can infer contradiction.

In the second comparison, we check if the number of bags in the hypothesis is equal to the number of bags required to contain the total number of oranges in the premise. If they are equal, we can infer entailment. If they are not equal, we can infer contradiction.

Finally, we print the label based on the comparison results."

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

START_EXAMPLE
Possible labels: entailment, contradiction, neutral
Premise: Two weeks after the controversial study, a report by the ECB asserts that ""cryptocurrency poses minimal risk"" despite previous warnings.
Hypothesis: The ECB asserts that ""risk is negligible in the crypto market"" 2 weeks after a controversial study was published.
Answer:```python

- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

### Instruction:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

Only answer with the script. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

You must write Python code starting from 2 input sentences, based on these rules:
- first you define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs (one variable per entity, per sentence);
- extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). do not ignore any quantity or numerical information;
- next, use brief comments to explain what comparison you do between the defined variables (do not use their values in the comments). Any comparison you do should be do through code as well.;
- refrain from concluding in the comments the entailment/contradiction or neutral relation;
- use the variables to perform calculations if necessary and finally compare them accordingly to infer one of the following: 
    - ""entailment"": the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise
    - ""contradiction"": at least one aspect in the hypothesis contradicts the premise
    - ""neutral"": the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either
- use the correct comparison operators (i.e., if we know ""A is more than B"", then we can either check if A>B for entailment or if B<=A for contradiction).
- sometimes the textual information indicates neutrality and no comparison is needed.

In this script, we define variables with representative names for the numerical entities in both inputs, and extract all quantities as valid numbers (integers or floats). We then use brief comments to explain what comparison we do between the defined variables.

The script first checks if the hypothesis value contradicts the estimate of more than 'employees_level_1_premise'. If the hypothesis value is less than or equal to the premise value, then we can infer contradiction.

Next, we check if the number of college graduates in the hypothesis contradicts the number of college graduates reported in the premise. If the number of college graduates in the hypothesis is not equal to the number of college graduates reported in the premise, then we can infer contradiction.

Finally, if the hypothesis values and estimates do not contradict the premise ones, we can infer entailment."
