# the hypothesis refers to the number of US saving bonds that Robert purchased
# the premise mentions that bonds are sold in $50 or $100 denominations only
# the hypothesis mentions that bonds are sold in $less than 70 or $100 denominations only
# the hypothesis is more specific than the premise, so we can infer entailment
