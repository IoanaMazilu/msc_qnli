# Here, there are no numerical entities in the premise or the hypothesis to compare.
# The comparison is based on the textual information.

# The premise and hypothesis both talk about the denomination of the bonds that Robert purchased.
# The premise mentions that the bonds are sold in $50 or $100 denominations, while the hypothesis mentions that the bonds are sold in $70 or $100 denominations.
# Since the denominations in the premise and the hypothesis are different, we cannot explicitly entail the hypothesis from the premise.
# However, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as it also talks about the number of bonds that Robert purchased, which is not specified in the premise.
