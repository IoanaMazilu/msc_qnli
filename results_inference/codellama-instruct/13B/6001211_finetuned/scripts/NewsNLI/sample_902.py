# There are no numerical entities in both the premise and the hypothesis

# The premise mentions that Reid and other Democratic leadership members were re-elected, but does not provide information about who exactly was elected
# The hypothesis mentions that Warren and two other women senators joined the leadership team, but does not specify whether they replaced anyone or were added to the existing team

# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction based on the available information
