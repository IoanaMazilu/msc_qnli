# There are no numerical entities in the premise or the hypothesis to compare

# The hypothesis mentions that Henrik Stenson shot an eight-under-par 64 in Dubai, which is not mentioned in the premise
# The premise mentions that Stenson would become the first man to claim the Race to Dubai if he won in Dubai
# However, the premise does not specify the score of the win, so we cannot infer entailment or contradiction
