# There are no numerical entities in both inputs, so no variables are defined.

# The hypothesis and premise both refer to the posing of serious ethical questions by certain sites.
# However, the type of sites in question is different. The premise mentions "such sites", while the hypothesis specifies "open-source anti-bribe sites".
# This difference cannot be entailed from the premise, so the relation is neutral.
