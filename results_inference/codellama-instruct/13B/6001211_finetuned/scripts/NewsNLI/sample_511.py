# There are no numerical entities in the premise or the hypothesis
# The premise mentions that Suarez was the No. 2 person in the rebel group
# The hypothesis also mentions that Suarez was the No. 2 leader in the FARC guerrilla group
# However, the premise does not explicitly state that Suarez was the leader of the FARC
# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction based on the numerical values
