# There are no numerical entities in both inputs, so no variables are defined.

# The hypothesis mentions a full investigation and suspension of AirAsia flights between two cities, which are also mentioned in the premise.
# The premise does not specify the type of investigation or the duration of the suspension, which are not mentioned in the hypothesis either.
# Therefore, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either.
