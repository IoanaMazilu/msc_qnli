# The hypothesis talks about Sweden adopting the euro currency in 1999, while the premise only mentions that Sweden and Britain did not adopt the euro currency in its initial phase when it was launched in January 1999.
# There is no information in the premise about Sweden's decision to adopt the euro currency later.
# Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be entailed from the premise.
