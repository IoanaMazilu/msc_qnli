asteroid_diameter_premise = 100  # feet
asteroid_diameter_hypothesis = 100  # feet

# the hypothesis talks about the diameter of an asteroid that will pass close to Earth, which is also mentioned in the premise
# the premise and hypothesis do not provide any numerical values to compare, so no comparison is needed

# since the premise and hypothesis both mention an asteroid with the same diameter passing close to Earth, we can infer entailment
