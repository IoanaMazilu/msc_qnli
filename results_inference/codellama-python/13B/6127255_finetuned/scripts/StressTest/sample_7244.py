# Ayisha's father's age will be twice Shankar's age after 10 years.
# Ayisha's father's age will be twice Shankar's age after 30 years.

# The hypothesis and premise both talk about the age ratio between Ayisha's father and Shankar in the future.
# However, the time in the future when they will be compared is different.

# If the time in the future is different, then the age ratio at that time cannot be explicitly entailed from the premise.

# Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is neutral.
