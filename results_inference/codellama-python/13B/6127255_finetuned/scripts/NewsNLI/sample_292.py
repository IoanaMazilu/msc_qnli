# There are no numerical entities in the premise or the hypothesis, so no variables are defined.

# The premise and hypothesis both discuss the legality and morality of a sentence.
# The premise states that even if the sentence is legal, it may be immoral, and the hypothesis states that even if the sentence is legal, it may not be moral.
# These two statements are not contradictory, but they also don't entail one another.
