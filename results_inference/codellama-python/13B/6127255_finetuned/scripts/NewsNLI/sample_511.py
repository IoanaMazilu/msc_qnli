# The premise mentions that Suarez had more military experience than Cano, but does not provide a numerical comparison.
# The hypothesis mentions that Suarez was the No. 2 leader in the FARC group, but does not provide a numerical comparison.

# Since the premise and the hypothesis do not provide any numerical comparison, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction.
