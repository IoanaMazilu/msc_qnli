# There are no numerical entities in the premise or the hypothesis, so no variables are defined.

# The premise mentions that Reid and other members of the Democratic leadership were re-elected, but does not provide information about the gender of these members.
# The hypothesis mentions that Warren and two other women senators joined the Senate Democratic leadership team, but does not specify whether these women were re-elected.

# Since the premise does not mention anything about the gender of the Democratic leadership members, and the hypothesis does not mention anything about the election status of the women senators, we cannot infer any entailment or contradiction based on these two sentences.
