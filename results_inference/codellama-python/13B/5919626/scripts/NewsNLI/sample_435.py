# the premise and hypothesis mention the same age of the 19-year-old and the 17-year-old
# the premise also mentions that the 19-year-old was charged with murder, attempted murder and possession of a firearm by a felon in connection with the shooting death of the 17-year-old
# the hypothesis also mentions that the 19-year-old was charged with murder, attempted murder and possession of a firearm by a felon in connection with the shooting death of the 17-year-old
# therefore, the premise and hypothesis are equivalent and we can infer entailment
