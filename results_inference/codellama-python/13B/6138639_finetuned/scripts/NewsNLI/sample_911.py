# In this case, there are no numerical entities in the premise or the hypothesis, so no variables are defined.
# The premise and hypothesis do not provide any numerical information, so no comparison is needed.

# The premise and hypothesis both mention Henrik Stenson shooting an eight-under-par 64 in Dubai, which is the same event.
# Therefore, the hypothesis can be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise.
