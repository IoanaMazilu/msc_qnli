# There are no numerical entities in the premise or the hypothesis, so no variables are defined

# The premise mentions the re-election of Reid and other members of the Democratic leadership, but does not mention any specific women senators
# The hypothesis mentions the re-election of Warren and two other women senators, but does not mention any specific members of the Democratic leadership
# Therefore, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from it either
