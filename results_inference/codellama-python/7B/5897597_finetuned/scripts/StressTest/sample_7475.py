# The premise and hypothesis are about definitions of "Sophie Germain" primes.
# They both define a prime number p for which 2p+1 is also prime.
# The hypothesis adds the condition that p is multiplied by 8.

# We don't have any numerical values to compare, so we can't infer entailment or contradiction.
# The hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise either.
