# The premise and hypothesis are about definitions of "Sophie Germain" primes.
# They both define a prime number p for which 2p+1 is also prime.
# The hypothesis adds the condition that p is less than 4, which is not specified in the premise.
# Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be fully and explicitly entailed from the premise.
