# There are no numerical entities in the premise to define variables for comparison.

# The hypothesis mentions the same event (burning of a fireball) and the same condition (brighter than a full moon) as the premise.
# However, the hypothesis does not provide any information about the size or weight of the fireball.
# Therefore, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction based on the available information.
